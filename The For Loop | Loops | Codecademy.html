JavaScript","time":3,"type":"informational","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"### What will you learn?\n\nIn this course, you will learn programming fundamentals with JavaScript syntax. The concepts covered in this course lay the foundation for using JavaScript in any environment.\n\nAfter this course, you will be able to:\n- implement JavaScript data types, built-in methods, and variables\n- use conditionals to control the flow of a program in JavaScript\n- construct functions and pass data through them\n- identify global and block-level scopes in JavaScript\n- use arrays to store lists of data\n- use loops to execute blocks of code multiple times\n- use iterator methods to simplify the process of looping over arrays\n- use JavaScript ES6 object syntax to model real-world items\n\nLearning is social. Whatever you're working on, be sure to connect with the Codecademy community in the [forums](https://discuss.codecademy.com/). Remember to check in with the community regularly, including for things like asking for code reviews on your project work and providing code reviews to others in the [projects category](https://discuss.codecademy.com/c/project/1833), which can help to reinforce what you’ve learned. \n\n### What will you create?\n\nThroughout this course, you will be tasked with applying the concepts learned in projects. Here is a preview of some of the projects featured in this course:\n\n- [Kelvin Weather](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/projects/kelvin-weather-javascript)\n\nBuild fluency in JavaScript fundamentals by practicing variables and printing to the console to create a temperature convertor.\n\n- [Sleep Debt Calculator](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/projects/sleep-debt-calculator)\n\nPractice functions to help us build separation of concerns by building a calculator to tell us if we are getting enough sleep each week.\n\n- [Whale Talk](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/projects/whale-talk)\n\nMaster the art of looping by creating a program that talks like a whale!\n\nThese projects will help you practice building fluency in JavaScript. \n\nWe are excited for you to start your journey into Learn JavaScript!","progress":{"__typename":"ContentItemProgressSummary","content_item_id":"9b0fbd6ff394fc8d799199fb4c5359b7","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-03T14:27:18+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-03T14:27:18+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5c76d428aa33d1d2df000015","last_updated":"2024-04-03T14:27:18+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":null,"checklist":null,"kanban":null}}}},"02322be3e27948089ea042a86a9ada3d":{"__typename":"Article","id":"02322be3e27948089ea042a86a9ada3d","description":"Learn about the different features Codecademy has to offer!","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"make-the-most-of-your-codecademy-membership","title":"Make the Most of Your Codecademy Membership","time":null,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"Codecademy has helped [tens of millions of people](https://www.codecademy.com/learner-stories) to learn to code, everything from `hello world` to getting new tech jobs, but when it comes down to it, you get out what you put in.  If you want to be best set up for success, this guide is for you.\n\n## Valuable Resources \n\nThere are hundreds of hours of free content on Codecademy, and thousands of hours of material available with our paid plans; but no matter your membership level, the key to success is learning intelligently.  If you build the habits to use our features, it will be easier for you to master technical skills.\n\n### Mobile App\n\nKeep practicing and stay sharp as you go with our free mobile app on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codecademy-pro/id1376029326?ls=1\u0026mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryzac.codecademygo).\n\n### Workspaces\n\n[Workspaces](https://www.codecademy.com/pages/workspaces) allow learners to work in their own [integrated development environment (IDE)](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide) right inside Codecademy.  Build or try whatever you want for free with these unguided sandboxes, share your code, or keep it private.  Not sure what to make?  Grab code from your coursework and use it as a template.\n\n![Workspace Image](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Build-Your-Portfolio-With-Codecademy-s-Workspace-1.png)\n\n### Cheatsheets\n\nCoding is less about memorization and more about understanding principles; cheatsheets help you quickly refresh your memory and get back to work.  You can find them linked in lessons, or head to their [homepage](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/cheatsheets/all) to find them all, broken down by the course section in which you learned them.\n\n### Docs\nCheatsheets are a handy companion for consuming coursework, but when coding in the real world, programmers need documentation.  With [Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs), you have an entirely open-source, free reference material to cover far more than a course can.\n\n![Gif of documentation](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Introducing-Docs---Your-New-Go-To-Resource-for-All-Things-Programming-1.gif)\n\n\n### Learn What to Learn\n\nNot certain what language to pick up or what career path to choose?  Flick through the [Learn What to Learn course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-what-to-learn), where we've consolidated the best resources to help you make a choice with confidence.  An hour of planning now could save you days of wasted effort later.\n\nThere is also an excellent [forum post](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/guide-essential-things-to-know-about-coding-from-day-one/394538) by Galina, one of our curriculum developers, that discusses how to best get started when beginning your coding journey.\n\n### Community\nLearning to code is challenging, but it's easier if you can team up.

Read this article to read and find out! ","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"javascript-versions","title":"JavaScript Versions: ES6 and Before","time":5,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"You might have seen the term \"ES6\" or \"JavaScript ES6\"  and wondered what it actually means. Well wonder no further, because we're going to dive into what ES6 is and how it relates to JavaScript! \n\nFirst, let's bring in some history. JavaScript was introduced in 1995 by the company Netscape Communications as a scripting language for web designers and programmers to interact with web pages. The next year,  Netscape submitted JavaScript to a standards developing organization called Ecma International to create standards for a scripting language (a type of programming language). In 1997, Ecma International released ECMA-262 which sets standards for the first version of a scripting language called ECMAScript, shortened to ES. \n\nThese new ECMAScript standards provided rules for the architecture of JavaScript features. As new programming paradigms emerged and developers sought new features, newer versions of ECMAScript provided a basis for consistency between new and old JavaScript versions. \n\nTo fully distinguish the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript: if you want to create an app or program you can use JavaScript \u0026mdash; if you want to create a new scripting language you can follow the guidelines in ECMAScript. So, when you see ES6 or JavaScript ES6, it means that that version of JavaScript is following the specifications in the sixth edition of ECMAScript! You might also see ES2015 instead of ES6, but both terminologies are referring to the same 6th edition of ECMAScript that was released in 2015. Take a look at the timeline below to see how JavaScript has evolved over the years:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-article-assets/javascript_timeline.svg\" alt=\"Timeline showing the evolution of JS editions from inception to 2018\"\u003e\n\nNow, you may be asking, what makes an update in 2015 still relevant today when there are more recent updates like ES7 and ES8? \n\nWell, despite the release of newer versions, ES6 is actually the biggest update made to ECMAScript since the first edition released in 1997! Some developers even refer to ES6 as \"Modern JavaScript\" because of all the major additions. There were so many great features added to help JavaScript developers that include: \n* new keywords like `let` and `const` to declare variables\n* new function syntax using Arrow functions\n* creation of Classes\n* parameters with default values\n* promises for asynchronous actions\n* and many more!\n\n\nUp-to-date browsers now support most of the ES6 features which allow developers to take advantage of these new additions. ES6 ultimately allows programmers to save time and write more concise code. Take for example pre-ES6 syntax for function expressions:\n```js\nvar greeting = function() {\n  console.log('Hello World!');  \n};\n```\nWith ES6 arrow functions, we can transform the expression above into: \n\n```js\nconst greeting = () =\u003e console.log('Hello World'); \n```\nHowever, arrow functions are not just simply syntactical re-writes. As with other ES6 features, there are other underlying benefits and tradeoffs to consider. Nonetheless, there has been a strong adoption of ES6 in the development community. Benefits such as new ES6 syntax, make it easier to utilize a popular programming paradigm, Object Oriented Programming (OOP). With this change, developers in other languages who are used to OOP have a smoother transition into learning and using JavaScript. Another reason for the popularity of ES6 is correlated with the usage of ES6 in popular frameworks like React.  So, if you want to learn the newest tools and frameworks, you will have to pick up ES6 along the way.  \n\nThis being said, we shouldn’t disregard legacy code, i.e. older versions of JavaScript. In fact, there are still many projects that are built and maintained with legacy code! If you want the ability and freedom to work on any sort of JavaScript project, you should familiarize yourself with pre-ES6 and ES6 JavaScript syntax. But don't worry, we cover both pre-ES6 and ES6 in our JavaScript course.

One of the biggest changes was two new keywords, `let` and `const`, to create, or _declare_, variables. Prior to the ES6, programmers could only use the `var` keyword to declare variables. \n\n```js\nvar myName = 'Arya';\nconsole.log(myName);\n// Output: Arya\n```\n\nLet's consider the example above:\n\n1. `var`, short for variable, is a JavaScript _keyword_ that creates, or _declares_, a new variable.\n2. `myName` is the variable's name. Capitalizing in this way is a standard convention in JavaScript called _camel casing_. In camel casing you group words into one, the first word is lowercase, then every word that follows will have its first letter uppercased. (e.g. camelCaseEverything). \n3. `=` is the _assignment operator_. It assigns the value (`'Arya'`) to the variable (`myName`). \n4. `'Arya'` is the _value_ assigned (`=`) to the variable `myName`. You can also say that the `myName` variable is _initialized_ with a value of `'Arya'`. \n5. After the variable is declared, the string value `'Arya'` is printed to the console by referencing the variable name: `console.log(myName)`. \n\nThere are a few general rules for naming variables: \n* Variable names cannot start with numbers. \n* Variable names are case sensitive, so `myName` and `myname` would be different variables. It is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.\n* Variable names cannot be the same as _keywords_. For a comprehensive list of keywords check out \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN's keyword documentation\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nIn the next exercises, we will learn why ES6's `let` and `const` are the preferred variable keywords by many programmers. Because there is still a ton of code written prior to ES6, it's helpful to be familiar with the pre-ES6 `var` keyword.\n\nIf you want to learn more about `var` and the quirks associated with it, check out the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN var documentation\u003c/a\u003e.\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054e","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054d","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"d06e3f20637a377ff7e95603af7853e5","sourceId":null,"title":"Create a Variable: let","slug":"let","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:24Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390558","instructions":"Create a `let` variable called `changeMe` and set it equal to the boolean `true`.","hint":"To create a variable using the `let` keyword, first add `let` followed by the name of the variable and use the `=` operator to assign it a value. \n```js\nlet thisVariable = false;\n```\n","test_type":"mochaTest","test_code":"console.log = function() {};\nconst { assert } = require('chai');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst Structured = require('structured');\n\nconst code = fs.readFileSync('main.js', 'utf8');\n\ndescribe('', function () {\n  it('', function() {\n    let structureOne = function() {\n      let changeMe = true\n    };\n\n    let isMatchOne = Structured.match(code, structureOne);\n\n    assert.isOk(isMatchOne, 'Did you declare a variable named `changeMe` using the `let` keyword and assign `changeMe` a value of `true`?');\n  });\n});\n","test_options":{"withBabel":false}},{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390559","instructions":"On the line after `changeMe` is declared, set the value of `changeMe` to be the boolean `false`.\n\nTo check if `changeMe` was reassigned, log the value saved to `changeMe` to the console.\n","hint":"In the example below, the variable `thisVariable` is first set to the value `44` then changed to `'I am a string'`.\n```js\nlet thisVariable = 44;\nthisVariable = 'I am a string';\n```","test_type":"mochaTest","test_code":"console.log = function() {};\nvar rewire = require('rewire'),\n    appModule = rewire('../main.js');\nconst { assert, expect } = require('chai');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst Structured = require('structured');\n\nconst code = fs.readFileSync('main.js', 'utf8');\n\ndescribe('', function () {\n  it('', function() {\n    const changeMe = appModule.__get__('changeMe')\n  \texpect(changeMe, 'Did you create a variable named `changeMe`?').to.exist;\n    expect(changeMe, 'Did you set `changeMe` to `false`?').to.eql(false);\n  });\n\n  it('', function() {\n    let structureOne = function() {\n      console.log(changeMe);\n    };\n\n    let isMatchOne = Structured.match(code, structureOne)\n\n    assert.isOk(isMatchOne, 'Did you `console.log()` `changeMe`?')\n  });\n});\n","test_options":{"withBabel":true}}],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2020-04-27T20:33:04Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ef0cb026eebaa00122169d1","slug":"learn-javascript-variables-letV2","type":"node"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":6.183333},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390555","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390556","type":"Narrative","content":"As mentioned in the previous exercise, the `let` keyword was introduced in ES6.

A _multi-line comment_ will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with `/*` to begin the comment, and `*/` to end the comment.\n\n  ```js\n  /*\n  This is all commented \n  console.log(10);\n  None of this is going to run!\n  console.log(99);\n  */\n  ```\nYou can also use this syntax to comment something out in the middle of a line of code:\n  ```js\n  console.log(/*IGNORED!*/ 5);  // Still just prints 5 \n  ```\n\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54d1d19724a04390517","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54d1d19724a04390518","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"46d0941a3e955bee4783a4cb616d48b9","sourceId":null,"title":"Data Types","slug":"types","published":true,"setup_command":"","created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:24Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54d1d19724a04390521","instructions":"On line 1, log the string `'JavaScript'` to the console.","hint":"Use `console.log()` to print `'JavaScript'` to the console.

In JavaScript, there are eight fundamental data types:\n\n- _Number_: Any number, including numbers with decimals: `4`, `8`, `1516`, `23.42`.\n- _BigInt_: Any number, greater than 2\u003csup\u003e53\u003c/sup\u003e-1 or less than -(2\u003csup\u003e53\u003c/sup\u003e-1), with n appended to the number: 1234567890123456n.\n- _String_: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: `' ... '` or double quotes `\" ... \"`, though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.\n- _Boolean_: This data type only has two possible values\u0026mdash; either `true` or `false` (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a \"yes\" or \"no\" question.\n- _Null_:  This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword `null` (without quotes).\n- _Undefined_: This data type is denoted by the keyword `undefined` (without quotes).  It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than `null`. `undefined` means that a given value does not exist.\n- _Symbol_: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.\n- _Object_: Collections of related data.\n\nThe first 7 of those types are considered _primitive data types_. They are the most basic data types in the language. _Objects_ are more complex, and you’ll learn much more about them as you progress through JavaScript. At first, eight types may not seem like that many, but soon you’ll observe the world opens with possibilities once you start leveraging each one. As you learn more about objects, you’ll be able to create complex collections of data.\n\nBut before we do that, let's get comfortable with strings and numbers!\n\n```js\nconsole.log('Location of Codecademy headquarters: 575 Broadway, New York City');\nconsole.log(40);\n```\nIn the example above, we first printed a string.

Let's call the `.random()` method from the built-in `Math` object:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(Math.random()); // Prints a random number between 0 and 1\n```\nIn the example above, we called the `.random()` method by appending the object name with the dot operator, the name of the method, and opening and closing parentheses. This method returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). \n\nTo generate a random number between 0 and 50, we could multiply this result by 50, like so: \n\n```js\nMath.random() * 50;\n```\n\nThe example above will likely evaluate to a decimal. To ensure the answer is a whole number, we can take advantage of another useful `Math` method called `Math.floor()`. \n\n`Math.floor()` takes a decimal number, and rounds down to the nearest whole number. You can use `Math.floor()` to round down a random number like this:\n\n```js\nMath.floor(Math.random() * 50);\n```\nIn this case:\n1. `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1.\n2. We then multiply that number by `50`, so now we have a number between 0 and 50.\n3. Then, `Math.floor()` rounds the number down to the nearest whole number.\n\nIf you wanted to see the number printed to the terminal, you would still need to use a `console.log()` statement:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 50)); // Prints a random whole number between 0 and 50\n```\n\nTo see all of the properties and methods on the `Math` object, take a look at \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"\u003ethe documentation here\u003c/a\u003e.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439053e","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439053f","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"fae7954a45c3b36d14388b06132b5699","sourceId":null,"title":"Review","slug":"review","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:24Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2020-02-29T22:53:45Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ea9d21b6c7a070012b09a7e","slug":"introduction-to-javascript-review-types-operators","type":"node"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.7},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390548","type":"Narrative","content":"Let's take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:\n\n- Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with `console.log()`.\n- We can write single-line comments with `//` and multi-line comments between `/*` and `*/`.\n- There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.\n- Numbers are any number without quotes: `23.8879`\n- Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: `'Sample String'`\n- The built-in arithmetic operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.\n- Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information.

For example: `'hello'.toUpperCase()`.\n- We can access properties and methods by using the `.`, dot operator. \n- Built-in objects, including `Math`, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.\n\nHere are a few more resources to add to your toolkit:\n\n- [Codecademy Docs: JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript)\n- [Codecademy Workspaces: JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/workspaces/new)\n\nMake sure to bookmark these links so you have them at your disposal.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390546","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390547","type":"OutputTerminal"}]}],"progress":{"__typename":"LessonProgressSummary","content_item_id":"c713e2f51a6e85c0a7937e6e65c5ef5d","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-03T14:27:39+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-29T15:41:08+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5c76d428aa33d1d2df000015","last_updated":"2024-04-29T15:41:08+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":[10,0],"checklist":null,"kanban":null}},"type":"lesson","progress_pct":100,"exercises_completed":10,"exercises_total":10,"current_exercise_checkpoints_completed":0}},"e61daaa3d8a04a5094311d4007efcc52":{"__typename":"Quiz","id":"e61daaa3d8a04a5094311d4007efcc52","description":"Test your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals with this quiz.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":false,"published":true,"slug":"learn-javascript-variables-quiz","title":"Variables","time":null,"type":"quiz","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"progress":{"__typename":"QuizProgressSummary","content_item_id":"e61daaa3d8a04a5094311d4007efcc52","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5c76d428aa33d1d2df000015","last_updated":null,"record":null,"total":null,"correct":null,"pct":null,"highest_pct":null,"passed":false,"passed_any":false,"taken":false,"type":"quiz","quiz_attempts":[]},"assessment_ids":["5b1da44eb2f3fb4fb0092216","5b1da44eb2f3fb4fb0092220","5b1da44eb2f3fb4fb0092233","5b858b1339652c569388ac78","5b1da44eb2f3fb4fb009220b"],"assessments":[{"__typename":"MultipleChoice","id":"5b1da44eb2f3fb4fb0092216","type":"multiple_choice","prompt":"What is the correct way to declare a new variable that you can change?","correct_answer":1,"answers":[{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`let myName: 'Sloan';`","reason":"To declare a variable, you use the `=` operator not a colon."},{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`let myName = 'Sloan';`","reason":"Right on! `let` is used to declare variables that can be changed."},{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`const myName = 'Sloan';`","reason":"A variable declared with `const` cannot be changed."},{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`myName = 'Sloan';`","reason":"We must use a keyword to indicate a variable.

For instance:\n\n```js\n10 \u003c 12 // Evaluates to true\n```\n\nIt can be helpful to think of comparison statements as questions. When the answer is \"yes\", the statement evaluates to `true`, and when the answer is \"no\", the statement evaluates to `false`. The code above would be asking: is 10 less than 12? Yes! So `10 \u003c 12` evaluates to `true`. \n\nWe can also use comparison operators on different data types like strings: \n\n```js\n'apples' === 'oranges' // false\n```\n\nIn the example above, we're using the _identity operator_ (`===`) to check if the string `'apples'` is the same as the string `'oranges'`.  Since the two strings are not the same, the comparison statement evaluates to `false`. \n\nAll comparison statements evaluate to either `true` or `false` and are made up of:\n\n* Two values that will be compared. \n* An operator that separates the values and compares them accordingly (`\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`,`\u003e=`,`===`,`!==`).\n\nLet's practice using these comparison operators!","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf39067d","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf39067e","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"e5bb570275770607b806929bb8bc4d5c","sourceId":null,"title":"Logical Operators","slug":"logical-operators","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf390687","instructions":"In **main.js** there are two variables `mood` and `tirednessLevel`. \n\nLet's create an `if...else` statement that checks if `mood` is `'sleepy'` and `tirednessLevel` is greater than `8`. \n\nIf both conditions evaluate to `true`, then `console.log()` the string `'time to sleep'`.

In JavaScript, there are operators that work with boolean values known as _logical operators_. We can use logical operators to add more sophisticated logic to our conditionals. There are three logical operators:\n* the  _and_ operator (`\u0026\u0026`)\n* the _or_ operator (`||`)\n* the _not_ operator, otherwise known as the _bang_ operator (`!`)\n\n\nWhen we use the `\u0026\u0026` operator, we are checking that two things are `true`: \n```js\nif (stopLight === 'green' \u0026\u0026 pedestrians === 0) {\n  console.log('Go!');\n} else {\n  console.log('Stop');\n}\n```\nWhen using the `\u0026\u0026` operator, both conditions *must* evaluate to `true` for the entire condition to evaluate to `true` and execute. Otherwise, if either condition is `false`, the `\u0026\u0026` condition will evaluate to `false` and the `else` block will execute. \n\nIf we only care about either condition being `true`, we can use the `||` operator:\n```js\nif (day === 'Saturday' || day === 'Sunday') {\n  console.log('Enjoy the weekend!');\n} else {\n  console.log('Do some work.');\n}\n```\nWhen using the `||` operator, only one of the conditions must evaluate to `true` for the overall statement to evaluate to `true`. In the code example above, if either `day === 'Saturday'` or `day === 'Sunday'` evaluates to `true` the `if`'s condition will evaluate to `true` and its code block will execute. If the first condition in an `||` statement evaluates to `true`, the second condition won't even be checked. Only if `day === 'Saturday'` evaluates to `false` will `day === 'Sunday'` be evaluated. The code in the `else` statement above will execute only if both comparisons evaluate to `false`.\n\nThe `!` _not operator_ reverses, or _negates_, the value of a boolean:\n```js\nlet excited = true;\nconsole.log(!excited); // Prints false\n\nlet sleepy = false;\nconsole.log(!sleepy); // Prints true\n```\nEssentially, the `!` operator will either take a `true` value and pass back `false`, or it will take a `false` value and pass back `true`. \n\nLogical operators are often used in conditional statements to add another layer of logic to our code.

In programming, we often find ourselves needing to check multiple values and handling each of them differently. For example:\n```js\nlet groceryItem = 'papaya';\n\nif (groceryItem === 'tomato') {\n  console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');\n} else if (groceryItem === 'papaya'){\n  console.log('Papayas are $1.29');\n} else {\n  console.log('Invalid item');\n}\n```\nIn the code above, we have a series of conditions checking for a value that matches a  `groceryItem` variable. Our code works fine, but imagine if we needed to check 100 different values! Having to write that many `else if` statements sounds like a pain!\n\nA  [`switch` statement](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/switch?page_ref=catalog) provides an alternative syntax that is easier to read and write. A `switch` statement looks like this:\n\n```js\nlet groceryItem = 'papaya';\n\nswitch (groceryItem) {\n  case 'tomato':\n    console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');\n    break;\n  case 'lime':\n    console.log('Limes are $1.49');\n    break;\n  case 'papaya':\n    console.log('Papayas are $1.29');\n    break;\n  default:\n    console.log('Invalid item');\n    break;\n}\n\n// Prints 'Papayas are $1.29'\n```\n\n* The `switch` keyword initiates the statement and is followed by `( ... )`, which contains the value that each `case` will compare. In the example, the value or expression of the `switch` statement is `groceryItem`.\n* Inside the block, `{ ... }`, there are multiple `case`s. The `case` keyword checks if the expression matches the specified value that comes after it. The value following the first `case` is `'tomato'`. If the value of `groceryItem` equalled `'tomato'`, that `case`'s `console.log()` would run.\n* The value of `groceryItem` is `'papaya'`, so the third `case` runs\u0026mdash; `Papayas are $1.29` is logged to the console.\n* The `break` keyword tells the computer to exit the block and not execute any more code or check any other cases inside the code block. Note: Without `break` keywords, the first matching case will run, but so will every subsequent case regardless of whether or not it matches—including the default. This behavior is different from `if`/`else` conditional statements that execute only one block of code. \n* At the end of each `switch` statement, there is a `default` statement.

Measure the width of the rectangle.\n2. Measure the height of the rectangle.\n3. Multiply the width and height of the rectangle.\n\nWith practice, you can calculate the area of the rectangle without being instructed with these three steps every time. \n\nWe can calculate the area of one rectangle with the following code:\n\n```js\nconst width = 10;\nconst height = 6;\nconst area =  width * height;\nconsole.log(area); // Output: 60\n```\nImagine being asked to calculate the area of three different rectangles: \n\n```js\n// Area of the first rectangle\nconst width1 = 10;\nconst height1 = 6;\nconst area1 =  width1 * height1;\n\n// Area of the second rectangle\nconst width2 = 4;\nconst height2 = 9;\nconst area2 =  width2 * height2;\n\n// Area of the third rectangle\nconst width3 = 10;\nconst height3 = 10;\nconst area3 =  width3 * height3;\n```\n\nIn programming, we often use code to perform a specific task multiple times. Instead of rewriting the same code, we can group a block of code together and associate it with one task, then we can reuse that block of code whenever we need to perform the task again. We achieve this by creating a _function_. A function is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task. \n\nIn this lesson, you will learn how to create and use functions, and how they can be used to create clearer and more concise code.","instructions":"Take a look at the provided GIF.

One way to create a function is by using a _function declaration_. Just like how a variable declaration binds a value to a variable name, a function declaration binds a function to a name, or an _identifier_.\nTake a look at the anatomy of a function declaration below:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/declaration.svg\" alt=\"Diagram showing the syntax of a function declaration\"\u003e\n\nA function declaration consists of: \n* The `function` keyword.\n* The name of the function, or its identifier, followed by parentheses.\n* A function body, or the block of statements required to perform a specific task, enclosed in the function’s curly brackets, `{ }`.\n\nA function declaration is a function that is bound to an identifier, or name. In the next exercise we'll go over how to run the code inside the function body. \n\nWe should also be aware of the _hoisting_ feature in JavaScript which allows access to function declarations before they're defined. \n\nTake a look at example of hoisting:\n```js\ngreetWorld(); // Output: Hello, World!\n\nfunction greetWorld() {\n  console.log('Hello, World!');\n}\n```\n\nNotice how hoisting allowed `greetWorld()` to be called before the `greetWorld()` function was defined! Since hoisting isn't considered good practice, we simply want you to be aware of this feature.\n\nIf you want to read more about hoisting, check out \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN documentation on hoisting\u003c/a\u003e. \n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a45e","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a45d","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"518f76047e7387f9211831dfc3e04f49","sourceId":null,"title":"Calling a Function","slug":"functions","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a469","instructions":"Imagine that you manage an online store.

Everyone who lives on the planet Earth is in the global scope of the stars. The stars are accessible _globally_. Meanwhile, if you live in a city, you may see the city skyline or the river.

This will throw a `ReferenceError` since `color` only exists within the scope of those two blocks \u0026mdash; it is never defined in the global scope.\n- While we use block scope, we still pollute our namespace by reusing the same variable name twice.

These methods are specifically called on arrays to make common tasks, like adding and removing elements, more straightforward. \n\nOne method, [`.push()`,](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays/push?page_ref=catalog) allows us to add items to the end of an array. Here is an example of how this is used:\n\n```js\nconst itemTracker = ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2'];\n\nitemTracker.push('item 3', 'item 4');\n\nconsole.log(itemTracker); \n// Output: ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3', 'item 4'];\n```\nSo, how does `.push()` work? \n\n* We access the `push` method by using dot notation, connecting `push` to `itemTracker` with a period. \n* Then we call it like a function. That's because `.push()` is a function and one that JavaScript allows us to use right on an array. \n* `.push()` can take a single argument or multiple arguments separated by commas. In this case, we're adding two elements: `'item 3'` and `'item 4'` to `itemTracker`.\n* Notice that `.push()` changes, or _mutates_, `itemTracker`. You might also see `.push()` referred to as a _destructive_ array method since it changes the initial array.\n\nIf you're looking for a method that will mutate an array by adding elements to it, then `.push()` is the method for you!

Well what happens if we try to change an array inside a function? Does the array keep the change after the function call or is it scoped to inside the function?\n\nTake a look at the following example where we call `.push()` on an array inside a function. Recall, the `.push()` method mutates, or changes, an array:\n```js\nconst flowers = ['peony', 'daffodil', 'marigold'];\n\nfunction addFlower(arr) {\n  arr.push('lily');\n}\n\naddFlower(flowers);\n\nconsole.log(flowers); // Output: ['peony', 'daffodil', 'marigold', 'lily']\n```\nLet's go over what happened in the example:\n* The `flowers` array that has 3 elements. \n* The function `addFlower()` has a parameter of `arr` uses `.push()` to add a `'lily'` element into `arr`.\n* We call `addFlower()` with an argument of `flowers` which will execute the code inside `addFlower`.\n* We check the value of `flowers` and it now includes the `'lily'` element! The array was mutated! \n\nSo when you pass an array into a function, if the array is mutated inside the function, that change will be maintained outside the function as well. You might also see this concept explained as _pass-by-reference_ since what we're actually passing to the function is a reference to where the variable memory is stored and changing the memory. \n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fcf","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd0","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"9f2ea421b8bbf0d5cd88d37ea9e88129","sourceId":null,"title":"Nested Arrays","slug":"nested-arrays","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fdb","instructions":"Let's make a nested array!

In this lesson, we learned these concepts regarding arrays:\n\n* Arrays are lists that store data in JavaScript. \n* Arrays are created with brackets `[]`.\n* Each item inside of an array is at a numbered position, or index, starting at `0`. \n* We can access one item in an array using its index, with syntax like: `myArray[0]`.\n* We can also change an item in an array using its index, with syntax like `myArray[0] = 'new string'`; \n* Arrays have a `length` property, which allows you to see how many items are in an array.\n* Arrays have their own methods, including `.push()` and `.pop()`, which add and remove items from an array, respectively.\n* Arrays have many methods that perform different tasks, such as `.slice()` and `.shift()`, you can find documentation at the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMozilla Developer Network\u003c/a\u003e website. \n* Some built-in methods are mutating, meaning the method will change the array, while others are not mutating. You can always check the documentation.  \n* Variables that contain arrays can be declared with `let` or `const`. Even when declared with `const`, arrays are still mutable. However, a variable declared with `const` cannot be reassigned. \n* Arrays mutated inside of a function will keep that change even outside the function. \n* Arrays can be nested inside other arrays. \n* To access elements in nested arrays chain indices using bracket notation. \n\nLearning how to work with and manipulate arrays will help you work with chunks of data! \n","instructions":"Looking for more ways to practice?

One way to give computers these instructions is with a [`for` loop](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/loops?page_ref=catalog). \n\nThe typical `for` loop includes an _iterator variable_ that usually appears in all three expressions. The iterator variable is initialized, checked against the stopping condition, and assigned a new value on each loop iteration. Iterator variables can have any name, but it’s best practice to use a descriptive variable name.\n\nA `for` loop contains three expressions separated by `;` inside the parentheses: \n1. an _initialization_ starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.\n2. a _stopping condition_ is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated against\u0026mdash; if the condition evaluates to `true` the code block will run, and if it evaluates to `false` the code will stop.\n3. an _iteration statement_ is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.\n\nThe `for` loop syntax looks like this:\n```js\nfor (let counter = 0; counter \u003c 4; counter++) {\n  console.log(counter);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the output would be the following:\n```\n0\n1\n2\n3\n```\n\nLet’s break down the example:\n* The initialization is `let counter = 0`, so the loop will start counting at `0`.\n* The stopping condition is `counter \u003c 4`, meaning the loop will run as long as the iterator variable, `counter`, is less than 4.\n* The iteration statement is `counter++`. This means after each loop, the value of `counter` will increase by 1. For the first iteration `counter` will equal `0`, for the second iteration `counter` will equal 1, and so on.\n* The code block is inside of the curly braces, `console.log(counter)`, will execute until the condition evaluates to `false`. The condition will be false when `counter` is greater than or equal to 4 \u0026mdash; the point that the condition becomes false is sometimes called the _stop condition_.\n\nThis `for` loop makes it possible to write `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` programmatically.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae26a","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae269","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"c29fa351e15793999c178f2afd90e2ad","sourceId":null,"title":"Looping in Reverse","slug":"for-loop-ii","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae272","instructions":"Make a `for` loop that loops backwards printing `3` to `0` to the console.

For example, we can use a `for` loop to perform the same operation on each element on an array. [Arrays](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays?page_ref=catalog) hold lists of data, like customer names or product information. Imagine we owned a store and wanted to increase the price of every product in our catalog. That could be a lot of repeating code, but by using a `for` loop to iterate through the array we could accomplish this task easily. \n\nTo loop through each element in an array, a `for` loop should use the array's `.length` property in its condition. \n\nCheck out the example below to see how `for` loops iterate on arrays:\n```js\nconst animals = ['Grizzly Bear', 'Sloth', 'Sea Lion'];\nfor (let i = 0; i \u003c animals.length; i++){\n  console.log(animals[i]);\n}\n```\n\nThis example would give you the following output:\n```\nGrizzly Bear\nSloth\nSea Lion\n```\nIn the loop above, we've named our iterator variable `i`. This is a variable naming convention you'll see in a lot of loops. When we use `i` to iterate through arrays we can think of it as being short-hand for the word **i**ndex. Notice how our stopping condition checks that `i` is less than `animals.length`. Remember that arrays are zero-indexed, the index of the last element of an array is equivalent to the length of that array minus 1. If we tried to access an element at the index of `animals.length` we will have gone too far!\n\nWith `for` loops, it’s easier for us to work with elements in arrays.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae274","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"6642f808bb47dd50f44e97d27ef64045","sourceId":null,"title":"Nested Loops","slug":"for-loops-iii","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae27c","instructions":"Imagine you're a big-wig programmer for a social media platform!

We're going to teach you about a different type of loop: the [`while` loop](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/loops?page_ref=catalog). To start, let's convert a `for` loop into a `while` loop:\n```js\n// A for loop that prints 1, 2, and 3\nfor (let counterOne = 1; counterOne \u003c 4; counterOne++){\n  console.log(counterOne);\n}\n\n// A while loop that prints 1, 2, and 3\nlet counterTwo = 1;\nwhile (counterTwo \u003c 4) {\n  console.log(counterTwo);\n  counterTwo++;\n}\n```\nLet's break down what's happening with our `while` loop syntax: \n- The `counterTwo` variable is declared before the loop. We can access it inside our `while` loop since it's in the global scope. \n- We start our loop with the keyword `while` followed by our stopping condition, or _test condition_. This will be evaluated before each round of the loop. While the condition evaluates to `true`, the block will continue to run. Once it evaluates to `false` the loop will stop. \n- Next, we have our loop's code block which prints `counterTwo` to the console and increments `counterTwo`. \n\nWhat would happen if we didn't increment `counterTwo` inside our block? If we didn't include this, `counterTwo` would always have its initial value, `1`. That would mean the testing condition `counterTwo \u003c 4` would always evaluate to `true` and our loop would never stop running! Remember, this is called an _infinite loop_ and it's something we always want to **avoid**. Infinite loops can take up all of your computer's processing power potentially freezing your computer. \n\nSo you may be wondering when to use a `while` loop! The syntax of a `while` loop is ideal when we don’t know in advance how many times the loop should run. Think of eating like a `while` loop: when you start taking bites, you don't know the exact number you'll need to become full. Rather you'll eat `while` you're hungry. In situations when we want a loop to execute an undetermined number of times, `while` loops are the best choice.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae280","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"5ff652197775cc38ceb58babcaa6fba1","sourceId":null,"title":"Do...While Statements","slug":"do-while-statement","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae28b","instructions":"We'd like a program to simulate part of the cake-baking process.

Aptly named, `.forEach()` will execute the same code for each element of an array.  \n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-iterators/iterator%20anatomy.svg\" alt=\"Diagram outlining the parts of an array iterator including the array identifier, the section that is the iterator, and the callback function\"\u003e\n\nThe code above will log a nicely formatted list of the groceries to the console.  Let's explore the syntax of invoking `.forEach()`. \n* `groceries.forEach()` calls the `forEach` method on the `groceries` array. \n* `.forEach()` takes an argument of callback function. Remember, a callback function is a function passed as an argument into another function. \n* `.forEach()` loops through the array and executes the callback function for each element. During each execution, the current element is passed as an argument to the callback function.\n* The return value for `.forEach()` will always be `undefined`.\n\nAnother way to pass a callback for `.forEach()` is to use arrow function syntax. \n```js\ngroceries.forEach(groceryItem =\u003e console.log(groceryItem));\n```\n\nWe can also define a function beforehand to be used as the callback function.\n```js\nfunction printGrocery(element){\n  console.log(element);\n}\n\ngroceries.forEach(printGrocery);\n```\nThe above example uses a function declaration but you can also use a function expression or arrow function as well. \n\nAll three code snippets do the same thing. In each array iteration method, we can use any of the three examples to supply a callback function as an argument to the iterator.

The [`.reduce()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays/reduce?page_ref=catalog) method returns a single value after iterating through the elements of an array, thereby _reducing_ the array.  Take a look at the example below:\n\n```js\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 4, 10];\n\nconst summedNums = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) =\u003e {\n  return accumulator + currentValue\n})\n\nconsole.log(summedNums) // Output: 17\n```\nHere are the values of `accumulator` and `currentValue` as we iterate through the `numbers` array: \n\u003cdiv class=\"narrative-table-container\"\u003e\n\n| Iteration |`accumulator` |`currentValue` |return value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First | 1 | 2 | 3\n| Second | 3 | 4 | 7\n| Third | 7 | 10 | 17\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow let's go over the use of `.reduce()` from the example above: \n* `numbers` is an array that contains numbers. \n* `summedNums` is a variable that stores the returned value of invoking `.reduce()` on `numbers`. \n* `numbers.reduce()` calls the `.reduce()` method on the `numbers` array and takes in a callback function as argument. \n* The callback function has two parameters, `accumulator` and `currentValue`. The value of `accumulator` starts off as the value of the first element in the array and the `currentValue` starts as the second element. To see the value of `accumulator` and `currentValue` change, review the chart above. \n* As `.reduce()` iterates through the array, the return value of the callback function becomes the `accumulator` value for the next iteration, `currentValue` takes on the value of the current element in the looping process. \n\nThe `.reduce()` method can also take  an optional second parameter to set an initial value for `accumulator` (remember, the first argument is the callback function!).  For instance: \n\n```js\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 4, 10];\n\nconst summedNums = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) =\u003e {\n  return accumulator + currentValue\n}, 100)  // \u003c- Second argument for .reduce()\n\nconsole.log(summedNums); // Output: 117\n```\nHere's an updated chart that accounts for the second argument of `100`: \n\u003cdiv class=\"narrative-table-container\"\u003e\n\n| Iteration # |`accumulator` |`currentValue` |return value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First | 100 | 1 | 101\n| Second | 101 | 2 | 103\n| Third | 103 | 4 | 107\n| Fourth | 107 | 10 | 117\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390281","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390282","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"17735007ebeff1004ea04ba83bdd0469","sourceId":null,"title":"Iterator Documentation","slug":"documentation","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a1639028e","instructions":"In the code editor, there is an array called `words`.

If we told you to \"count to three,\" we would expect you to say the numbers \"one\", \"two\", and \"three\". We assumed you would know to start with \"one\" and end with \"three\". With programming, we need to be more explicit with our directions to the computer. Here's how we might tell the computer to \"count to three\":\n\n```js\nfor (let i = 1; i \u003c= 3; i++) {\n  console.log(i);\n}\n```\n\nWhen we speak to other humans, we share a vocabulary that provides quick ways to communicate complicated concepts. When we say the word \"bake\", it calls to mind a familiar subroutine\u0026mdash; preheating an oven, putting something into an oven for a set amount of time, and finally removing it. This allows us to _abstract_ away a lot of the details and communicate key concepts more concisely. Instead of listing all those details, we can say, \"We baked a cake,\" and still impart all that meaning to you. \n\nIn this lesson, we'll learn how to use “abstraction” in programming by writing functions. In addition to allowing us to reuse our code, functions help to make clear, readable programs. If you encounter `countToThree()` in a program, you might be able to quickly guess what the function does without having to stop and read the function's body. \n\nWe're also going to learn about a way to add another level of abstraction to our programming: _higher-order functions_.  _Higher-order functions_ are functions that accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output. This enables us to build abstractions on other abstractions, just like \"We hosted a birthday party\" is an abstraction that may build on the abstraction \"We made a cake.\"","instructions":"Using abstraction allows us to write more modular code, which is easier to read and debug.

And finally, a string is returned, telling us the name of the callback function that was passed in.\n\nBelow the higher-order function, we have another function aptly named `anotherFunc`. This function aspires to be called inside the higher-order function.\n\nLastly, we invoke `higherOrderFunc()`, passing in `anotherFunc` as its argument, thus fulfilling its dreams of being called by the higher-order function.\n\n```js\nhigherOrderFunc(() =\u003e {\n  for (let i = 0; i \u003c= 10; i++){\n    console.log(i);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we invoked `higherOrderFunc()` with an [anonymous function](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/functions/exercises/function-expressions) (a function without a name) that counts to 10. Anonymous functions can be arguments too!\n\nLet’s get some practice writing higher-order functions.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc21","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"13ad39262619c577db0c8a5fa08fe212","sourceId":null,"title":"Review","slug":"review","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:14:16Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node-14","server":null},"last_modified_at":"2020-05-27T18:52:02Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ef0e0a21dde1c00126fe11d","slug":"higher-order-functions-functions-as-parameters-revised","type":"node-14"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.1},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc28","type":"Narrative","content":"Great job!

When discussing _privacy_ in objects, we define it as the idea that only certain properties should be mutable or able to change in value.\n\nCertain languages have privacy built-in for objects, but JavaScript does not have this feature. Rather, JavaScript developers follow naming conventions that signal to other developers how to interact with a property. One common convention is to place an underscore `_` before the name of a property to mean that the property should not be altered. Here's an example of using `_` to prepend a property. \n\n```js\nconst bankAccount = {\n  _amount: 1000\n}\n```\nIn the example above, the `_amount` is not intended to be directly manipulated. \n\nEven so, it is still possible to reassign `_amount`:\n```js\nbankAccount._amount = 1000000;\n```\n\nIn later exercises, we'll cover the use of methods called _getters_ and _setters_.

Nonetheless, even with a setter method, it is still possible to directly reassign properties.

Here's where _factory functions_ come in. A real world factory manufactures multiple copies of an item quickly and on a massive scale. A factory function is a function that returns an object and can be reused to make multiple object instances. Factory functions can also have parameters allowing us to customize the object that gets returned.\n\nLet's say we wanted to create an object to represent monsters in JavaScript. There are many different types of monsters and we could go about making each monster individually but we can also use a factory function to make our lives easier. To achieve this diabolical plan of creating multiple monsters objects, we can use a factory function that has parameters: \n\n```js\nconst monsterFactory = (name, age, energySource, catchPhrase) =\u003e {\n  return { \n    name: name,\n    age: age, \n    energySource: energySource,\n    scare() {\n      console.log(catchPhrase);\n    } \n  }\n};\n```\n\nIn the `monsterFactory` function above, it has four parameters and returns an object that has the properties: `name`, `age`, `energySource`, and `scare()`. To make an object that represents a specific monster like a ghost, we can call `monsterFactory` with the necessary arguments and assign the return value to a variable:\n\n```js\nconst ghost = monsterFactory('Ghouly', 251, 'ectoplasm', 'BOO!');\nghost.scare(); // 'BOO!'\n```\nNow we have a `ghost` object as a result of calling `monsterFactory()` with the needed arguments. With `monsterFactory` in place, we don't have to create an object literal every time we need a new monster. Instead, we can invoke the `monsterFactory` function with the necessary arguments to \u003cdel\u003etake over the world\u003c/del\u003e make a monster for us!

This means when we pass a variable assigned to an object into a function as an argument, the computer interprets the parameter name as pointing to the space in memory holding that object.  As a result, functions which change object properties actually mutate the object permanently (even when the object is assigned to a `const` variable). \n \n```js\nconst spaceship = {\n  homePlanet : 'Earth',\n  color : 'silver'\n};\n \nlet paintIt = obj =\u003e {\n  obj.color = 'glorious gold'\n};\n \npaintIt(spaceship);\n \nspaceship.color // Returns 'glorious gold'\n \n```\nOur function `paintIt()` permanently changed the color of our `spaceship` object.

This allowed us to reassign it to a new object with `identified` and `'transport type'` properties with no problems. \n - When we tried the same thing using a function designed to reassign the object passed into it, the reassignment didn't stick (even though calling `console.log()` on the object produced the expected result). \n -  When we passed `spaceship` into that function, `obj` became a reference to the memory location of the `spaceship` object, but *not* to the `spaceship` variable. This is because the `obj` parameter of the `tryReassignment()` function is a variable in its own right. The body of `tryReassignment()` has no knowledge of the `spaceship` variable at all! \n - When we did the reassignment in the body of  `tryReassignment()`, the `obj` variable came to refer to the memory location of the object ` {'identified' : false, 'transport type' : 'flying'}`, while the `spaceship` variable was completely unchanged from its earlier value.","instructions":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"461f055d5e438176b653004a8aec2c33","sourceId":null,"title":"Looping Through Objects","slug":"for-in","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcc09","instructions":"Using `for...in`, iterate through the `spaceship.crew` object in the code editor and `console.log()` a list of crew roles and names in the following format: `'[crew member's role]: [crew member's name]'`, e.g.,`'chief officer: Dan'`.

Read this article to read and find out! ","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"javascript-versions","title":"JavaScript Versions: ES6 and Before","time":5,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"You might have seen the term \"ES6\" or \"JavaScript ES6\"  and wondered what it actually means. Well wonder no further, because we're going to dive into what ES6 is and how it relates to JavaScript! \n\nFirst, let's bring in some history. JavaScript was introduced in 1995 by the company Netscape Communications as a scripting language for web designers and programmers to interact with web pages. The next year,  Netscape submitted JavaScript to a standards developing organization called Ecma International to create standards for a scripting language (a type of programming language). In 1997, Ecma International released ECMA-262 which sets standards for the first version of a scripting language called ECMAScript, shortened to ES. \n\nThese new ECMAScript standards provided rules for the architecture of JavaScript features. As new programming paradigms emerged and developers sought new features, newer versions of ECMAScript provided a basis for consistency between new and old JavaScript versions. \n\nTo fully distinguish the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript: if you want to create an app or program you can use JavaScript \u0026mdash; if you want to create a new scripting language you can follow the guidelines in ECMAScript. So, when you see ES6 or JavaScript ES6, it means that that version of JavaScript is following the specifications in the sixth edition of ECMAScript! You might also see ES2015 instead of ES6, but both terminologies are referring to the same 6th edition of ECMAScript that was released in 2015. Take a look at the timeline below to see how JavaScript has evolved over the years:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-article-assets/javascript_timeline.svg\" alt=\"Timeline showing the evolution of JS editions from inception to 2018\"\u003e\n\nNow, you may be asking, what makes an update in 2015 still relevant today when there are more recent updates like ES7 and ES8? \n\nWell, despite the release of newer versions, ES6 is actually the biggest update made to ECMAScript since the first edition released in 1997! Some developers even refer to ES6 as \"Modern JavaScript\" because of all the major additions. There were so many great features added to help JavaScript developers that include: \n* new keywords like `let` and `const` to declare variables\n* new function syntax using Arrow functions\n* creation of Classes\n* parameters with default values\n* promises for asynchronous actions\n* and many more!\n\n\nUp-to-date browsers now support most of the ES6 features which allow developers to take advantage of these new additions. ES6 ultimately allows programmers to save time and write more concise code. Take for example pre-ES6 syntax for function expressions:\n```js\nvar greeting = function() {\n  console.log('Hello World!');  \n};\n```\nWith ES6 arrow functions, we can transform the expression above into: \n\n```js\nconst greeting = () =\u003e console.log('Hello World'); \n```\nHowever, arrow functions are not just simply syntactical re-writes. As with other ES6 features, there are other underlying benefits and tradeoffs to consider. Nonetheless, there has been a strong adoption of ES6 in the development community. Benefits such as new ES6 syntax, make it easier to utilize a popular programming paradigm, Object Oriented Programming (OOP). With this change, developers in other languages who are used to OOP have a smoother transition into learning and using JavaScript. Another reason for the popularity of ES6 is correlated with the usage of ES6 in popular frameworks like React.  So, if you want to learn the newest tools and frameworks, you will have to pick up ES6 along the way.  \n\nThis being said, we shouldn’t disregard legacy code, i.e. older versions of JavaScript. In fact, there are still many projects that are built and maintained with legacy code! If you want the ability and freedom to work on any sort of JavaScript project, you should familiarize yourself with pre-ES6 and ES6 JavaScript syntax. But don't worry, we cover both pre-ES6 and ES6 in our JavaScript course.

One of the biggest changes was two new keywords, `let` and `const`, to create, or _declare_, variables. Prior to the ES6, programmers could only use the `var` keyword to declare variables. \n\n```js\nvar myName = 'Arya';\nconsole.log(myName);\n// Output: Arya\n```\n\nLet's consider the example above:\n\n1. `var`, short for variable, is a JavaScript _keyword_ that creates, or _declares_, a new variable.\n2. `myName` is the variable's name. Capitalizing in this way is a standard convention in JavaScript called _camel casing_. In camel casing you group words into one, the first word is lowercase, then every word that follows will have its first letter uppercased. (e.g. camelCaseEverything). \n3. `=` is the _assignment operator_. It assigns the value (`'Arya'`) to the variable (`myName`). \n4. `'Arya'` is the _value_ assigned (`=`) to the variable `myName`. You can also say that the `myName` variable is _initialized_ with a value of `'Arya'`. \n5. After the variable is declared, the string value `'Arya'` is printed to the console by referencing the variable name: `console.log(myName)`. \n\nThere are a few general rules for naming variables: \n* Variable names cannot start with numbers. \n* Variable names are case sensitive, so `myName` and `myname` would be different variables. It is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.\n* Variable names cannot be the same as _keywords_. For a comprehensive list of keywords check out \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN's keyword documentation\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nIn the next exercises, we will learn why ES6's `let` and `const` are the preferred variable keywords by many programmers. Because there is still a ton of code written prior to ES6, it's helpful to be familiar with the pre-ES6 `var` keyword.\n\nIf you want to learn more about `var` and the quirks associated with it, check out the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN var documentation\u003c/a\u003e.\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054e","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054d","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"d06e3f20637a377ff7e95603af7853e5","sourceId":null,"title":"Create a Variable: let","slug":"let","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:24Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390558","instructions":"Create a `let` variable called `changeMe` and set it equal to the boolean `true`.","hint":"To create a variable using the `let` keyword, first add `let` followed by the name of the variable and use the `=` operator to assign it a value. \n```js\nlet thisVariable = false;\n```\n","test_type":"mochaTest","test_code":"console.log = function() {};\nconst { assert } = require('chai');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst Structured = require('structured');\n\nconst code = fs.readFileSync('main.js', 'utf8');\n\ndescribe('', function () {\n  it('', function() {\n    let structureOne = function() {\n      let changeMe = true\n    };\n\n    let isMatchOne = Structured.match(code, structureOne);\n\n    assert.isOk(isMatchOne, 'Did you declare a variable named `changeMe` using the `let` keyword and assign `changeMe` a value of `true`?');\n  });\n});\n","test_options":{"withBabel":false}},{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390559","instructions":"On the line after `changeMe` is declared, set the value of `changeMe` to be the boolean `false`.\n\nTo check if `changeMe` was reassigned, log the value saved to `changeMe` to the console.\n","hint":"In the example below, the variable `thisVariable` is first set to the value `44` then changed to `'I am a string'`.\n```js\nlet thisVariable = 44;\nthisVariable = 'I am a string';\n```","test_type":"mochaTest","test_code":"console.log = function() {};\nvar rewire = require('rewire'),\n    appModule = rewire('../main.js');\nconst { assert, expect } = require('chai');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst Structured = require('structured');\n\nconst code = fs.readFileSync('main.js', 'utf8');\n\ndescribe('', function () {\n  it('', function() {\n    const changeMe = appModule.__get__('changeMe')\n  \texpect(changeMe, 'Did you create a variable named `changeMe`?').to.exist;\n    expect(changeMe, 'Did you set `changeMe` to `false`?').to.eql(false);\n  });\n\n  it('', function() {\n    let structureOne = function() {\n      console.log(changeMe);\n    };\n\n    let isMatchOne = Structured.match(code, structureOne)\n\n    assert.isOk(isMatchOne, 'Did you `console.log()` `changeMe`?')\n  });\n});\n","test_options":{"withBabel":true}}],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2020-04-27T20:33:04Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ef0cb026eebaa00122169d1","slug":"learn-javascript-variables-letV2","type":"node"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":6.183333},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390555","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390556","type":"Narrative","content":"As mentioned in the previous exercise, the `let` keyword was introduced in ES6.

In such a case, the variable will be automatically initialized with a value of `undefined`:\n\n```js\nlet price;\nconsole.log(price); // Output: undefined\nprice = 350;\nconsole.log(price); // Output: 350\n``` \nNotice in the example above: \n* If we don't assign a value to a variable declared using the `let` keyword, it automatically has a value of `undefined`. \n* We can reassign the value of the variable. \n\n\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390554","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"7b0e7dbc507f3c725e9fd729fc9044d9","sourceId":null,"title":"Create a Variable: const","slug":"const","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:24Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439055e","instructions":"Create a constant variable named `entree` and set it to equal to the string `'Enchiladas'`.","hint":"Use the `const` keyword to declare a variable with a name and then use the `=` operator to assign a value to the variable. \n```js\nconst programmer = 'You';\n```\n","test_type":"mochaTest","test_code":"console.log = function() {};\nconst { assert } = require('chai');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst Structured = require('structured');\n\nconst code = fs.readFileSync('main.js', 'utf8');\n\ndescribe('', function () {\n  it('', function() {\n    let structureOne = function() {\n      const entree = $entree\n    };\n\n    varCallbacks = [\n      function($entree){\n        if($entree.value !== 'Enchiladas'){\n          return {failure: 'Did you assign `entree` a value of `\\'Enchiladas\\'`?'}\n        }\n        return true\n      }\n    ]\n\n    let isMatchOne = Structured.match(code, structureOne, { varCallbacks });\n    assert.isOk(isMatchOne, varCallbacks.failure || 'Did you declare a variable named `entree` using the `const` keyword?');\n  });\n});\n","test_options":{"withBabel":false}},{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439055f","instructions":"Just to check that you've saved the value of `'Enchiladas'` to `entree`, log the value of `entree` to the console.","hint":"To print something to the console, use the following syntax:\n\n```js\nconst greet = 'Hello World!';\n\nconsole.log(greet); // Output: Hello World\n```\n","test_type":"componentTest","test_code":"      if (Components.OutputTerminal.hasOutput(/Enchiladas/)) {\n        return { pass: true };\n      }\n      return {\n        pass: false,\n        errors: {\n          friendly: 'Did you log `\\'Enchiladas\\'` to the console?',\n          component: 'PersistentCodeEditor'\n        }\n      };","test_options":{}},{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390560","instructions":"Great, let's see what happens if you try to reassign a constant variable.\n\nPaste the following code to the bottom of your program.\n\n```js\nentree = 'Tacos'\n```\n\nThis code throws the following error when you run your code:\n\n```error\nTypeError: Assignment to constant variable.\n```\n\nAfter you clear this checkpoint, if you want to see about another quirk of `const` in action open the hint!

We're excited for what you'll be able to create with the JavaScript foundation you gain here. JavaScript powers the dynamic behavior on most websites, including this one. \n\nIn this lesson, you will learn introductory coding concepts including data types and built-in objects—essential knowledge for all aspiring developers.

Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.\n- _Boolean_: This data type only has two possible values\u0026mdash; either `true` or `false` (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a \"yes\" or \"no\" question.\n- _Null_:  This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword `null` (without quotes).\n- _Undefined_: This data type is denoted by the keyword `undefined` (without quotes).  It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than `null`. `undefined` means that a given value does not exist.\n- _Symbol_: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.\n- _Object_: Collections of related data.\n\nThe first 7 of those types are considered _primitive data types_. They are the most basic data types in the language. _Objects_ are more complex, and you’ll learn much more about them as you progress through JavaScript. At first, eight types may not seem like that many, but soon you’ll observe the world opens with possibilities once you start leveraging each one. As you learn more about objects, you’ll be able to create complex collections of data.\n\nBut before we do that, let's get comfortable with strings and numbers!\n\n```js\nconsole.log('Location of Codecademy headquarters: 575 Broadway, New York City');\nconsole.log(40);\n```\nIn the example above, we first printed a string. Our string isn't just a single word; it includes both capital and lowercase letters, spaces, and punctuation.\n\nNext, we printed the number 40, notice we did not use quotes.

Let's see `console.log()` and some real string methods in action!\n\n```js\nconsole.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); // Prints 'HELLO'\nconsole.log('Hey'.startsWith('H')); // Prints true\n```\nLet's look at each of the lines above:\n- On the first line, the `.toUpperCase()` method is called on the string instance `'hello'`. The result is logged to the console. This method returns a string in all capital letters: `'HELLO'`.\n- On the second line, the `.startsWith()` method is called on the string instance `'Hey'`. This method also accepts the character `'H'` as an input, or _argument_,  between the parentheses. Since the string `'Hey'` does start with the letter `'H'`, the method returns the boolean `true`. \n\nYou can find a list of built-in string methods in the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/prototype\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJavaScript documentation\u003c/a\u003e.

Let's call the `.random()` method from the built-in `Math` object:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(Math.random()); // Prints a random number between 0 and 1\n```\nIn the example above, we called the `.random()` method by appending the object name with the dot operator, the name of the method, and opening and closing parentheses. This method returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). \n\nTo generate a random number between 0 and 50, we could multiply this result by 50, like so: \n\n```js\nMath.random() * 50;\n```\n\nThe example above will likely evaluate to a decimal. To ensure the answer is a whole number, we can take advantage of another useful `Math` method called `Math.floor()`. \n\n`Math.floor()` takes a decimal number, and rounds down to the nearest whole number. You can use `Math.floor()` to round down a random number like this:\n\n```js\nMath.floor(Math.random() * 50);\n```\nIn this case:\n1. `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1.\n2. We then multiply that number by `50`, so now we have a number between 0 and 50.\n3. Then, `Math.floor()` rounds the number down to the nearest whole number.\n\nIf you wanted to see the number printed to the terminal, you would still need to use a `console.log()` statement:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 50)); // Prints a random whole number between 0 and 50\n```\n\nTo see all of the properties and methods on the `Math` object, take a look at \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"\u003ethe documentation here\u003c/a\u003e.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439053e","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439053f","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"fae7954a45c3b36d14388b06132b5699","sourceId":null,"title":"Review","slug":"review","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:24Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2020-02-29T22:53:45Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ea9d21b6c7a070012b09a7e","slug":"introduction-to-javascript-review-types-operators","type":"node"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.7},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390548","type":"Narrative","content":"Let's take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:\n\n- Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with `console.log()`.\n- We can write single-line comments with `//` and multi-line comments between `/*` and `*/`.\n- There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.\n- Numbers are any number without quotes: `23.8879`\n- Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: `'Sample String'`\n- The built-in arithmetic operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.\n- Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a `.` after the name of the object, for example: `'Hello'.length`. \n- Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses.

In JavaScript, there are operators that work with boolean values known as _logical operators_. We can use logical operators to add more sophisticated logic to our conditionals. There are three logical operators:\n* the  _and_ operator (`\u0026\u0026`)\n* the _or_ operator (`||`)\n* the _not_ operator, otherwise known as the _bang_ operator (`!`)\n\n\nWhen we use the `\u0026\u0026` operator, we are checking that two things are `true`: \n```js\nif (stopLight === 'green' \u0026\u0026 pedestrians === 0) {\n  console.log('Go!');\n} else {\n  console.log('Stop');\n}\n```\nWhen using the `\u0026\u0026` operator, both conditions *must* evaluate to `true` for the entire condition to evaluate to `true` and execute. Otherwise, if either condition is `false`, the `\u0026\u0026` condition will evaluate to `false` and the `else` block will execute. \n\nIf we only care about either condition being `true`, we can use the `||` operator:\n```js\nif (day === 'Saturday' || day === 'Sunday') {\n  console.log('Enjoy the weekend!');\n} else {\n  console.log('Do some work.');\n}\n```\nWhen using the `||` operator, only one of the conditions must evaluate to `true` for the overall statement to evaluate to `true`. In the code example above, if either `day === 'Saturday'` or `day === 'Sunday'` evaluates to `true` the `if`'s condition will evaluate to `true` and its code block will execute. If the first condition in an `||` statement evaluates to `true`, the second condition won't even be checked. Only if `day === 'Saturday'` evaluates to `false` will `day === 'Sunday'` be evaluated. The code in the `else` statement above will execute only if both comparisons evaluate to `false`.\n\nThe `!` _not operator_ reverses, or _negates_, the value of a boolean:\n```js\nlet excited = true;\nconsole.log(!excited); // Prints false\n\nlet sleepy = false;\nconsole.log(!sleepy); // Prints true\n```\nEssentially, the `!` operator will either take a `true` value and pass back `false`, or it will take a `false` value and pass back `true`. \n\nLogical operators are often used in conditional statements to add another layer of logic to our code.

In programming, we often find ourselves needing to check multiple values and handling each of them differently. For example:\n```js\nlet groceryItem = 'papaya';\n\nif (groceryItem === 'tomato') {\n  console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');\n} else if (groceryItem === 'papaya'){\n  console.log('Papayas are $1.29');\n} else {\n  console.log('Invalid item');\n}\n```\nIn the code above, we have a series of conditions checking for a value that matches a  `groceryItem` variable. Our code works fine, but imagine if we needed to check 100 different values! Having to write that many `else if` statements sounds like a pain!\n\nA  [`switch` statement](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/switch?page_ref=catalog) provides an alternative syntax that is easier to read and write. A `switch` statement looks like this:\n\n```js\nlet groceryItem = 'papaya';\n\nswitch (groceryItem) {\n  case 'tomato':\n    console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');\n    break;\n  case 'lime':\n    console.log('Limes are $1.49');\n    break;\n  case 'papaya':\n    console.log('Papayas are $1.29');\n    break;\n  default:\n    console.log('Invalid item');\n    break;\n}\n\n// Prints 'Papayas are $1.29'\n```\n\n* The `switch` keyword initiates the statement and is followed by `( ... )`, which contains the value that each `case` will compare. In the example, the value or expression of the `switch` statement is `groceryItem`.\n* Inside the block, `{ ... }`, there are multiple `case`s. The `case` keyword checks if the expression matches the specified value that comes after it. The value following the first `case` is `'tomato'`. If the value of `groceryItem` equalled `'tomato'`, that `case`'s `console.log()` would run.\n* The value of `groceryItem` is `'papaya'`, so the third `case` runs\u0026mdash; `Papayas are $1.29` is logged to the console.\n* The `break` keyword tells the computer to exit the block and not execute any more code or check any other cases inside the code block. Note: Without `break` keywords, the first matching case will run, but so will every subsequent case regardless of whether or not it matches—including the default. This behavior is different from `if`/`else` conditional statements that execute only one block of code. \n* At the end of each `switch` statement, there is a `default` statement. If none of the `case`s are true, then the code in the `default` statement will run.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a3","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a2","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"1bd8e532511877c26294a58104637186","sourceId":null,"title":"Review","slug":"review-control-flow","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2020-02-29T22:54:48Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ea9d240a69948001117fd98","slug":"learn-javascript-conditionals-review","type":"node"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.25},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf3906ab","type":"Narrative","content":"Way to go!

Measure the width of the rectangle.\n2. Measure the height of the rectangle.\n3. Multiply the width and height of the rectangle.\n\nWith practice, you can calculate the area of the rectangle without being instructed with these three steps every time. \n\nWe can calculate the area of one rectangle with the following code:\n\n```js\nconst width = 10;\nconst height = 6;\nconst area =  width * height;\nconsole.log(area); // Output: 60\n```\nImagine being asked to calculate the area of three different rectangles: \n\n```js\n// Area of the first rectangle\nconst width1 = 10;\nconst height1 = 6;\nconst area1 =  width1 * height1;\n\n// Area of the second rectangle\nconst width2 = 4;\nconst height2 = 9;\nconst area2 =  width2 * height2;\n\n// Area of the third rectangle\nconst width3 = 10;\nconst height3 = 10;\nconst area3 =  width3 * height3;\n```\n\nIn programming, we often use code to perform a specific task multiple times. Instead of rewriting the same code, we can group a block of code together and associate it with one task, then we can reuse that block of code whenever we need to perform the task again. We achieve this by creating a _function_. A function is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task. \n\nIn this lesson, you will learn how to create and use functions, and how they can be used to create clearer and more concise code.","instructions":"Take a look at the provided GIF.

One way to create a function is by using a _function declaration_. Just like how a variable declaration binds a value to a variable name, a function declaration binds a function to a name, or an _identifier_.\nTake a look at the anatomy of a function declaration below:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/declaration.svg\" alt=\"Diagram showing the syntax of a function declaration\"\u003e\n\nA function declaration consists of: \n* The `function` keyword.\n* The name of the function, or its identifier, followed by parentheses.\n* A function body, or the block of statements required to perform a specific task, enclosed in the function’s curly brackets, `{ }`.\n\nA function declaration is a function that is bound to an identifier, or name. In the next exercise we'll go over how to run the code inside the function body. \n\nWe should also be aware of the _hoisting_ feature in JavaScript which allows access to function declarations before they're defined. \n\nTake a look at example of hoisting:\n```js\ngreetWorld(); // Output: Hello, World!\n\nfunction greetWorld() {\n  console.log('Hello, World!');\n}\n```\n\nNotice how hoisting allowed `greetWorld()` to be called before the `greetWorld()` function was defined! Since hoisting isn't considered good practice, we simply want you to be aware of this feature.\n\nIf you want to read more about hoisting, check out \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN documentation on hoisting\u003c/a\u003e. \n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a45e","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a45d","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"518f76047e7387f9211831dfc3e04f49","sourceId":null,"title":"Calling a Function","slug":"functions","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a469","instructions":"Imagine that you manage an online store.

To create a return statement, we use the `return` keyword followed by the value that we wish to return. Like we saw above, if the value is omitted, `undefined` is returned instead.\n\nWhen a `return` statement is used in a function body, the execution of the function is stopped and the code that follows it will not be executed.

The second return statement `width * height` will not run. \n\nThe `return` keyword is powerful because it allows functions to produce an output.

These methods are specifically called on arrays to make common tasks, like adding and removing elements, more straightforward. \n\nOne method, [`.push()`,](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays/push?page_ref=catalog) allows us to add items to the end of an array. Here is an example of how this is used:\n\n```js\nconst itemTracker = ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2'];\n\nitemTracker.push('item 3', 'item 4');\n\nconsole.log(itemTracker); \n// Output: ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3', 'item 4'];\n```\nSo, how does `.push()` work? \n\n* We access the `push` method by using dot notation, connecting `push` to `itemTracker` with a period. \n* Then we call it like a function. That's because `.push()` is a function and one that JavaScript allows us to use right on an array. \n* `.push()` can take a single argument or multiple arguments separated by commas. In this case, we're adding two elements: `'item 3'` and `'item 4'` to `itemTracker`.\n* Notice that `.push()` changes, or _mutates_, `itemTracker`. You might also see `.push()` referred to as a _destructive_ array method since it changes the initial array.\n\nIf you're looking for a method that will mutate an array by adding elements to it, then `.push()` is the method for you!

Well what happens if we try to change an array inside a function? Does the array keep the change after the function call or is it scoped to inside the function?\n\nTake a look at the following example where we call `.push()` on an array inside a function. Recall, the `.push()` method mutates, or changes, an array:\n```js\nconst flowers = ['peony', 'daffodil', 'marigold'];\n\nfunction addFlower(arr) {\n  arr.push('lily');\n}\n\naddFlower(flowers);\n\nconsole.log(flowers); // Output: ['peony', 'daffodil', 'marigold', 'lily']\n```\nLet's go over what happened in the example:\n* The `flowers` array that has 3 elements. \n* The function `addFlower()` has a parameter of `arr` uses `.push()` to add a `'lily'` element into `arr`.\n* We call `addFlower()` with an argument of `flowers` which will execute the code inside `addFlower`.\n* We check the value of `flowers` and it now includes the `'lily'` element! The array was mutated! \n\nSo when you pass an array into a function, if the array is mutated inside the function, that change will be maintained outside the function as well. You might also see this concept explained as _pass-by-reference_ since what we're actually passing to the function is a reference to where the variable memory is stored and changing the memory. \n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fcf","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd0","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"9f2ea421b8bbf0d5cd88d37ea9e88129","sourceId":null,"title":"Nested Arrays","slug":"nested-arrays","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fdb","instructions":"Let's make a nested array!

In this lesson, we learned these concepts regarding arrays:\n\n* Arrays are lists that store data in JavaScript. \n* Arrays are created with brackets `[]`.\n* Each item inside of an array is at a numbered position, or index, starting at `0`. \n* We can access one item in an array using its index, with syntax like: `myArray[0]`.\n* We can also change an item in an array using its index, with syntax like `myArray[0] = 'new string'`; \n* Arrays have a `length` property, which allows you to see how many items are in an array.\n* Arrays have their own methods, including `.push()` and `.pop()`, which add and remove items from an array, respectively.\n* Arrays have many methods that perform different tasks, such as `.slice()` and `.shift()`, you can find documentation at the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMozilla Developer Network\u003c/a\u003e website. \n* Some built-in methods are mutating, meaning the method will change the array, while others are not mutating. You can always check the documentation.  \n* Variables that contain arrays can be declared with `let` or `const`. Even when declared with `const`, arrays are still mutable. However, a variable declared with `const` cannot be reassigned. \n* Arrays mutated inside of a function will keep that change even outside the function. \n* Arrays can be nested inside other arrays. \n* To access elements in nested arrays chain indices using bracket notation. \n\nLearning how to work with and manipulate arrays will help you work with chunks of data! \n","instructions":"Looking for more ways to practice?

One way to give computers these instructions is with a [`for` loop](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/loops?page_ref=catalog). \n\nThe typical `for` loop includes an _iterator variable_ that usually appears in all three expressions. The iterator variable is initialized, checked against the stopping condition, and assigned a new value on each loop iteration. Iterator variables can have any name, but it’s best practice to use a descriptive variable name.\n\nA `for` loop contains three expressions separated by `;` inside the parentheses: \n1. an _initialization_ starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.\n2. a _stopping condition_ is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated against\u0026mdash; if the condition evaluates to `true` the code block will run, and if it evaluates to `false` the code will stop.\n3. an _iteration statement_ is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.\n\nThe `for` loop syntax looks like this:\n```js\nfor (let counter = 0; counter \u003c 4; counter++) {\n  console.log(counter);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the output would be the following:\n```\n0\n1\n2\n3\n```\n\nLet’s break down the example:\n* The initialization is `let counter = 0`, so the loop will start counting at `0`.\n* The stopping condition is `counter \u003c 4`, meaning the loop will run as long as the iterator variable, `counter`, is less than 4.\n* The iteration statement is `counter++`. This means after each loop, the value of `counter` will increase by 1. For the first iteration `counter` will equal `0`, for the second iteration `counter` will equal 1, and so on.\n* The code block is inside of the curly braces, `console.log(counter)`, will execute until the condition evaluates to `false`. The condition will be false when `counter` is greater than or equal to 4 \u0026mdash; the point that the condition becomes false is sometimes called the _stop condition_.\n\nThis `for` loop makes it possible to write `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` programmatically.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae26a","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae269","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"c29fa351e15793999c178f2afd90e2ad","sourceId":null,"title":"Looping in Reverse","slug":"for-loop-ii","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae272","instructions":"Make a `for` loop that loops backwards printing `3` to `0` to the console.

For example, we can use a `for` loop to perform the same operation on each element on an array. [Arrays](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays?page_ref=catalog) hold lists of data, like customer names or product information. Imagine we owned a store and wanted to increase the price of every product in our catalog. That could be a lot of repeating code, but by using a `for` loop to iterate through the array we could accomplish this task easily. \n\nTo loop through each element in an array, a `for` loop should use the array's `.length` property in its condition. \n\nCheck out the example below to see how `for` loops iterate on arrays:\n```js\nconst animals = ['Grizzly Bear', 'Sloth', 'Sea Lion'];\nfor (let i = 0; i \u003c animals.length; i++){\n  console.log(animals[i]);\n}\n```\n\nThis example would give you the following output:\n```\nGrizzly Bear\nSloth\nSea Lion\n```\nIn the loop above, we've named our iterator variable `i`. This is a variable naming convention you'll see in a lot of loops. When we use `i` to iterate through arrays we can think of it as being short-hand for the word **i**ndex. Notice how our stopping condition checks that `i` is less than `animals.length`. Remember that arrays are zero-indexed, the index of the last element of an array is equivalent to the length of that array minus 1.

We're going to teach you about a different type of loop: the [`while` loop](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/loops?page_ref=catalog). To start, let's convert a `for` loop into a `while` loop:\n```js\n// A for loop that prints 1, 2, and 3\nfor (let counterOne = 1; counterOne \u003c 4; counterOne++){\n  console.log(counterOne);\n}\n\n// A while loop that prints 1, 2, and 3\nlet counterTwo = 1;\nwhile (counterTwo \u003c 4) {\n  console.log(counterTwo);\n  counterTwo++;\n}\n```\nLet's break down what's happening with our `while` loop syntax: \n- The `counterTwo` variable is declared before the loop. We can access it inside our `while` loop since it's in the global scope. \n- We start our loop with the keyword `while` followed by our stopping condition, or _test condition_. This will be evaluated before each round of the loop. While the condition evaluates to `true`, the block will continue to run. Once it evaluates to `false` the loop will stop. \n- Next, we have our loop's code block which prints `counterTwo` to the console and increments `counterTwo`. \n\nWhat would happen if we didn't increment `counterTwo` inside our block? If we didn't include this, `counterTwo` would always have its initial value, `1`. That would mean the testing condition `counterTwo \u003c 4` would always evaluate to `true` and our loop would never stop running! Remember, this is called an _infinite loop_ and it's something we always want to **avoid**. Infinite loops can take up all of your computer's processing power potentially freezing your computer. \n\nSo you may be wondering when to use a `while` loop! The syntax of a `while` loop is ideal when we don’t know in advance how many times the loop should run. Think of eating like a `while` loop: when you start taking bites, you don't know the exact number you'll need to become full. Rather you'll eat `while` you're hungry. In situations when we want a loop to execute an undetermined number of times, `while` loops are the best choice.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae280","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"5ff652197775cc38ceb58babcaa6fba1","sourceId":null,"title":"Do...While Statements","slug":"do-while-statement","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae28b","instructions":"We'd like a program to simulate part of the cake-baking process.

Let's explore the syntax of invoking `.forEach()`. \n* `groceries.forEach()` calls the `forEach` method on the `groceries` array. \n* `.forEach()` takes an argument of callback function. Remember, a callback function is a function passed as an argument into another function. \n* `.forEach()` loops through the array and executes the callback function for each element. During each execution, the current element is passed as an argument to the callback function.\n* The return value for `.forEach()` will always be `undefined`.\n\nAnother way to pass a callback for `.forEach()` is to use arrow function syntax. \n```js\ngroceries.forEach(groceryItem =\u003e console.log(groceryItem));\n```\n\nWe can also define a function beforehand to be used as the callback function.\n```js\nfunction printGrocery(element){\n  console.log(element);\n}\n\ngroceries.forEach(printGrocery);\n```\nThe above example uses a function declaration but you can also use a function expression or arrow function as well. \n\nAll three code snippets do the same thing. In each array iteration method, we can use any of the three examples to supply a callback function as an argument to the iterator. It's good to be aware of the different ways to pass in callback functions as arguments in iterators because developers have different stylistic preferences. Nonetheless, due to the strong adoption of ES6, we will be using arrow function syntax in the later exercises. \n\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a1639026b","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a1639026a","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"ec22cff017452ee3112d55d357864059","sourceId":null,"title":"The .map() Method","slug":"map","published":true,"setup_command":"","created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390273","instructions":"Add your code under the `animals` array and before the line `console.log(secretMessage.join(''));` \n\nUse `.map()` to create a new array that contains the first character of each string in the `animals` array.

Take a look at the example below:\n\n```js\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 4, 10];\n\nconst summedNums = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) =\u003e {\n  return accumulator + currentValue\n})\n\nconsole.log(summedNums) // Output: 17\n```\nHere are the values of `accumulator` and `currentValue` as we iterate through the `numbers` array: \n\u003cdiv class=\"narrative-table-container\"\u003e\n\n| Iteration |`accumulator` |`currentValue` |return value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First | 1 | 2 | 3\n| Second | 3 | 4 | 7\n| Third | 7 | 10 | 17\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow let's go over the use of `.reduce()` from the example above: \n* `numbers` is an array that contains numbers. \n* `summedNums` is a variable that stores the returned value of invoking `.reduce()` on `numbers`. \n* `numbers.reduce()` calls the `.reduce()` method on the `numbers` array and takes in a callback function as argument. \n* The callback function has two parameters, `accumulator` and `currentValue`. The value of `accumulator` starts off as the value of the first element in the array and the `currentValue` starts as the second element. To see the value of `accumulator` and `currentValue` change, review the chart above. \n* As `.reduce()` iterates through the array, the return value of the callback function becomes the `accumulator` value for the next iteration, `currentValue` takes on the value of the current element in the looping process. \n\nThe `.reduce()` method can also take  an optional second parameter to set an initial value for `accumulator` (remember, the first argument is the callback function!).  For instance: \n\n```js\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 4, 10];\n\nconst summedNums = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) =\u003e {\n  return accumulator + currentValue\n}, 100)  // \u003c- Second argument for .reduce()\n\nconsole.log(summedNums); // Output: 117\n```\nHere's an updated chart that accounts for the second argument of `100`: \n\u003cdiv class=\"narrative-table-container\"\u003e\n\n| Iteration # |`accumulator` |`currentValue` |return value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First | 100 | 1 | 101\n| Second | 101 | 2 | 103\n| Third | 103 | 4 | 107\n| Fourth | 107 | 10 | 117\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390281","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390282","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"17735007ebeff1004ea04ba83bdd0469","sourceId":null,"title":"Iterator Documentation","slug":"documentation","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a1639028e","instructions":"In the code editor, there is an array called `words`.

If we told you to \"count to three,\" we would expect you to say the numbers \"one\", \"two\", and \"three\". We assumed you would know to start with \"one\" and end with \"three\". With programming, we need to be more explicit with our directions to the computer. Here's how we might tell the computer to \"count to three\":\n\n```js\nfor (let i = 1; i \u003c= 3; i++) {\n  console.log(i);\n}\n```\n\nWhen we speak to other humans, we share a vocabulary that provides quick ways to communicate complicated concepts. When we say the word \"bake\", it calls to mind a familiar subroutine\u0026mdash; preheating an oven, putting something into an oven for a set amount of time, and finally removing it. This allows us to _abstract_ away a lot of the details and communicate key concepts more concisely. Instead of listing all those details, we can say, \"We baked a cake,\" and still impart all that meaning to you. \n\nIn this lesson, we'll learn how to use “abstraction” in programming by writing functions. In addition to allowing us to reuse our code, functions help to make clear, readable programs.

Since functions can behave like any other type of data in JavaScript, it might not surprise you to learn that functions can accept other functions as parameters. A _higher-order function_ is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both! We call functions that get passed in as parameters _callback functions_. Callback functions get invoked during the execution of the higher-order function.\n\nWhen we invoke a higher-order function, and pass another function in as an argument, we don't invoke the argument function. Invoking it would evaluate to passing in the return value of that function call. With callback functions, we pass in the function itself by typing the function name _without_ the parentheses:\n\n\n\n```js\nconst higherOrderFunc = param =\u003e {\n  param();\n  return `I just invoked ${param.name} as a callback function!`\n}\n \nconst anotherFunc = () =\u003e {\n  return 'I\\'m being invoked by the higher-order function!';\n}\n\nhigherOrderFunc(anotherFunc);\n```\n\nWe wrote a higher-order function `higherOrderFunc` that accepts a single parameter, `param`. Inside the body, `param` gets invoked using parentheses. And finally, a string is returned, telling us the name of the callback function that was passed in.\n\nBelow the higher-order function, we have another function aptly named `anotherFunc`. This function aspires to be called inside the higher-order function.\n\nLastly, we invoke `higherOrderFunc()`, passing in `anotherFunc` as its argument, thus fulfilling its dreams of being called by the higher-order function.\n\n```js\nhigherOrderFunc(() =\u003e {\n  for (let i = 0; i \u003c= 10; i++){\n    console.log(i);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we invoked `higherOrderFunc()` with an [anonymous function](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/functions/exercises/function-expressions) (a function without a name) that counts to 10.

However, there are cases in which we don't want other code simply accessing and updating an object's properties. When discussing _privacy_ in objects, we define it as the idea that only certain properties should be mutable or able to change in value.\n\nCertain languages have privacy built-in for objects, but JavaScript does not have this feature. Rather, JavaScript developers follow naming conventions that signal to other developers how to interact with a property. One common convention is to place an underscore `_` before the name of a property to mean that the property should not be altered. Here's an example of using `_` to prepend a property. \n\n```js\nconst bankAccount = {\n  _amount: 1000\n}\n```\nIn the example above, the `_amount` is not intended to be directly manipulated. \n\nEven so, it is still possible to reassign `_amount`:\n```js\nbankAccount._amount = 1000000;\n```\n\nIn later exercises, we'll cover the use of methods called _getters_ and _setters_. Both methods are used to respect the intention of properties prepended, or began, with `_`. Getters can return the value of internal properties and setters can safely reassign property values.

Here's where _factory functions_ come in. A real world factory manufactures multiple copies of an item quickly and on a massive scale. A factory function is a function that returns an object and can be reused to make multiple object instances. Factory functions can also have parameters allowing us to customize the object that gets returned.\n\nLet's say we wanted to create an object to represent monsters in JavaScript. There are many different types of monsters and we could go about making each monster individually but we can also use a factory function to make our lives easier. To achieve this diabolical plan of creating multiple monsters objects, we can use a factory function that has parameters: \n\n```js\nconst monsterFactory = (name, age, energySource, catchPhrase) =\u003e {\n  return { \n    name: name,\n    age: age, \n    energySource: energySource,\n    scare() {\n      console.log(catchPhrase);\n    } \n  }\n};\n```\n\nIn the `monsterFactory` function above, it has four parameters and returns an object that has the properties: `name`, `age`, `energySource`, and `scare()`. To make an object that represents a specific monster like a ghost, we can call `monsterFactory` with the necessary arguments and assign the return value to a variable:\n\n```js\nconst ghost = monsterFactory('Ghouly', 251, 'ectoplasm', 'BOO!');\nghost.scare(); // 'BOO!'\n```\nNow we have a `ghost` object as a result of calling `monsterFactory()` with the needed arguments.

\n\nYou're ready to start leveraging more elegant code for creating and accessing objects in your code!","instructions":"If you want to challenge yourself:\n* Find the value of `this` in a function inside of a method.\n* Learn the outcome of using a property that has the exact same name as a setter/getter method.\n* Create a new factory function that can create object instances of your choice.\n* Read documentation on other destructuring techniques and apply it to your code.\n* Try out other built-in object methods and learn what they do. \n"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c33c09df242fc454d3dcc4d","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c33c09df242fc454d3dcc4e","type":"OutputTerminal"}]}],"progress":{"__typename":"LessonProgressSummary","content_item_id":"74f455596aa57f02babe98881d4a7c5f","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5c76d428aa33d1d2df000015","last_updated":null,"record":null,"type":"lesson","progress_pct":0,"exercises_completed":0,"exercises_total":11,"current_exercise_checkpoints_completed":0}},{"__typename":"Quiz","id":"adb8ded8406cf61cd97713d8369d8374","description":"Check your knowledge of JavaScript Objects with this quick quiz.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":false,"published":true,"slug":"learn-javascript-objects-objects-quiz","title":"Objects","time":12,"type":"quiz","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"progress":{"__typename":"QuizProgressSummary","content_item_id":"adb8ded8406cf61cd97713d8369d8374","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5c76d428aa33d1d2df000015","last_updated":null,"record":null,"total":null,"correct":null,"pct":null,"highest_pct":null,"passed":false,"passed_any":false,"taken":false,"type":"quiz","quiz_attempts":[]},"assessment_ids":["5b212ece646caa5b485bafd3","5b212ece646caa5b485bafd8","5b212ece646caa5b485bafe4","5b212ece646caa5b485bafef","5b212ece646caa5b485baff3","5b212ece646caa5b485baff9","5b212ece646caa5b485baffe","5b212ece646caa5b485bb00a","5b212ece646caa5b485bb010","5b858f1239652c56a088aea2","5b8591795df3153e750be30a","5b85a8a0f242fc4e1283b897","5b85a8a139652c569388acac","5b85a8a31d197251326cfad3"],"assessments":[{"__typename":"MultipleChoice","id":"5b212ece646caa5b485bafd3","type":"multiple_choice","prompt":"Which of the following statements is correct?","correct_answer":1,"answers":[{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"Objects only store strings.","reason":"Objects store unordered data of any type as key-value pairs."},{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"Objects store unordered data of any type as key-value pairs.","reason":"Correct!"},{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"Objects store data in numbered positions.

With the seventh type, objects, we open our code to more complex possibilities. We can use JavaScript objects to model real-world things, like a basketball, or we can use objects to build the data structures that make the web possible. \n\nAt their core, JavaScript objects are containers storing related data and functionality, but that deceptively simple task is extremely powerful in practice.

We can also nest other objects in the `spaceship` such as a `telescope` or nest details about the spaceship's computers inside a parent `nanoelectronics` object.\n \n```js\nconst spaceship = {\n     telescope: {\n        yearBuilt: 2018,\n        model: '91031-XLT',\n        focalLength: 2032 \n     },\n    crew: {\n        captain: { \n            name: 'Sandra', \n            degree: 'Computer Engineering', \n            encourageTeam() { console.log('We got this!') } \n         }\n    },\n    engine: {\n        model: 'Nimbus2000'\n     },\n     nanoelectronics: {\n         computer: {\n            terabytes: 100,\n            monitors: 'HD'\n         },\n        'back-up': {\n           battery: 'Lithium',\n           terabytes: 50\n         }\n    }\n}; \n```\nWe can chain operators to access nested properties. We'll have to pay attention to which operator makes sense to use in each layer. It can be helpful to pretend you are the computer and evaluate each expression from left to right so that each operation starts to feel a little more manageable. \n```js\nspaceship.nanoelectronics['back-up'].battery; // Returns 'Lithium'\n```\nIn the preceding code:\n\n- First the computer evaluates `spaceship.nanoelectronics`, which results in an object containing the `back-up` and `computer` objects. \n- We accessed the  `back-up` object by appending `['back-up']`. \n- The  `back-up` object has a `battery` property, accessed with `.battery` which returned the value stored there: `'Lithium'`","instructions":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"7f657d452d381c660e2a0891cb364305","sourceId":null,"title":"Pass By Reference","slug":"pass-by-reference","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcc02","instructions":"Write a function `greenEnergy()` that has an object as a parameter and sets that object's `'Fuel Type'` property to `'avocado oil'`.

This means when we pass a variable assigned to an object into a function as an argument, the computer interprets the parameter name as pointing to the space in memory holding that object.  As a result, functions which change object properties actually mutate the object permanently (even when the object is assigned to a `const` variable). \n \n```js\nconst spaceship = {\n  homePlanet : 'Earth',\n  color : 'silver'\n};\n \nlet paintIt = obj =\u003e {\n  obj.color = 'glorious gold'\n};\n \npaintIt(spaceship);\n \nspaceship.color // Returns 'glorious gold'\n \n```\nOur function `paintIt()` permanently changed the color of our `spaceship` object. However, reassignment of the  `spaceship` variable wouldn't work in the same way: \n```js\nlet spaceship = {\n  homePlanet : 'Earth',\n  color : 'red'\n};\nlet tryReassignment = obj =\u003e {\n  obj = {\n    identified : false, \n    'transport type' : 'flying'\n  }\n  console.log(obj) // Prints {'identified': false, 'transport type': 'flying'}\n \n};\ntryReassignment(spaceship) // The attempt at reassignment does not work.\nspaceship // Still returns {homePlanet : 'Earth', color : 'red'};\n \nspaceship = {\n  identified : false, \n  'transport type': 'flying'\n}; // Regular reassignment still works.\n```\nLet's look at what happened in the code example:\n\n - We declared this `spaceship` object with `let`. This allowed us to reassign it to a new object with `identified` and `'transport type'` properties with no problems. \n - When we tried the same thing using a function designed to reassign the object passed into it, the reassignment didn't stick (even though calling `console.log()` on the object produced the expected result). \n -  When we passed `spaceship` into that function, `obj` became a reference to the memory location of the `spaceship` object, but *not* to the `spaceship` variable. This is because the `obj` parameter of the `tryReassignment()` function is a variable in its own right. The body of `tryReassignment()` has no knowledge of the `spaceship` variable at all! \n - When we did the reassignment in the body of  `tryReassignment()`, the `obj` variable came to refer to the memory location of the object ` {'identified' : false, 'transport type' : 'flying'}`, while the `spaceship` variable was completely unchanged from its earlier value.","instructions":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"461f055d5e438176b653004a8aec2c33","sourceId":null,"title":"Looping Through Objects","slug":"for-in","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcc09","instructions":"Using `for...in`, iterate through the `spaceship.crew` object in the code editor and `console.log()` a list of crew roles and names in the following format: `'[crew member's role]: [crew member's name]'`, e.g.,`'chief officer: Dan'`.

A key is like a variable name that points to a location in memory that holds a value.\n\n\u003cimg src=https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-objects/key%20value.svg\u003e\n\nA key's value can be of any data type in the language including functions or other objects. \n\nWe make a key-value pair by writing the key's name, or _identifier_, followed by a colon and then the value. We separate each key-value pair in an object literal with a comma (`,`).  Keys are strings, but when we have a key that does not have any special characters in it, JavaScript allows us to omit the quotation marks:\n\n\u003cimg src= https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-javascript-objects/javascript_object.svg \u003e\n\n```js\n// An object literal with two key-value pairs\nlet spaceship = {\n  'Fuel Type': 'diesel',\n  color: 'silver'\n};\n```\nThe `spaceship` object has two properties `Fuel Type` and `color`. `'Fuel Type'` has quotation marks because it contains a space character. \n\nLet's make some objects!","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcbd8","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcbd9","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},"7f654c3938c7433492415ad0a020f619":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"7f654c3938c7433492415ad0a020f619","sourceId":null,"title":"Accessing Properties","slug":"object-property-access","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcbe1","instructions":"Let's use the dot operator to access the value of `numCrew` from the `spaceship` object in the code editor.

This means when we pass a variable assigned to an object into a function as an argument, the computer interprets the parameter name as pointing to the space in memory holding that object.  As a result, functions which change object properties actually mutate the object permanently (even when the object is assigned to a `const` variable). \n \n```js\nconst spaceship = {\n  homePlanet : 'Earth',\n  color : 'silver'\n};\n \nlet paintIt = obj =\u003e {\n  obj.color = 'glorious gold'\n};\n \npaintIt(spaceship);\n \nspaceship.color // Returns 'glorious gold'\n \n```\nOur function `paintIt()` permanently changed the color of our `spaceship` object.

This allowed us to reassign it to a new object with `identified` and `'transport type'` properties with no problems. \n - When we tried the same thing using a function designed to reassign the object passed into it, the reassignment didn't stick (even though calling `console.log()` on the object produced the expected result). \n -  When we passed `spaceship` into that function, `obj` became a reference to the memory location of the `spaceship` object, but *not* to the `spaceship` variable.

When discussing _privacy_ in objects, we define it as the idea that only certain properties should be mutable or able to change in value.\n\nCertain languages have privacy built-in for objects, but JavaScript does not have this feature. Rather, JavaScript developers follow naming conventions that signal to other developers how to interact with a property. One common convention is to place an underscore `_` before the name of a property to mean that the property should not be altered. Here's an example of using `_` to prepend a property. \n\n```js\nconst bankAccount = {\n  _amount: 1000\n}\n```\nIn the example above, the `_amount` is not intended to be directly manipulated. \n\nEven so, it is still possible to reassign `_amount`:\n```js\nbankAccount._amount = 1000000;\n```\n\nIn later exercises, we'll cover the use of methods called _getters_ and _setters_. Both methods are used to respect the intention of properties prepended, or began, with `_`. Getters can return the value of internal properties and setters can safely reassign property values.

Here's where _factory functions_ come in. A real world factory manufactures multiple copies of an item quickly and on a massive scale. A factory function is a function that returns an object and can be reused to make multiple object instances. Factory functions can also have parameters allowing us to customize the object that gets returned.\n\nLet's say we wanted to create an object to represent monsters in JavaScript. There are many different types of monsters and we could go about making each monster individually but we can also use a factory function to make our lives easier. To achieve this diabolical plan of creating multiple monsters objects, we can use a factory function that has parameters: \n\n```js\nconst monsterFactory = (name, age, energySource, catchPhrase) =\u003e {\n  return { \n    name: name,\n    age: age, \n    energySource: energySource,\n    scare() {\n      console.log(catchPhrase);\n    } \n  }\n};\n```\n\nIn the `monsterFactory` function above, it has four parameters and returns an object that has the properties: `name`, `age`, `energySource`, and `scare()`. To make an object that represents a specific monster like a ghost, we can call `monsterFactory` with the necessary arguments and assign the return value to a variable:\n\n```js\nconst ghost = monsterFactory('Ghouly', 251, 'ectoplasm', 'BOO!');\nghost.scare(); // 'BOO!'\n```\nNow we have a `ghost` object as a result of calling `monsterFactory()` with the needed arguments. With `monsterFactory` in place, we don't have to create an object literal every time we need a new monster. Instead, we can invoke the `monsterFactory` function with the necessary arguments to \u003cdel\u003etake over the world\u003c/del\u003e make a monster for us!

If we told you to \"count to three,\" we would expect you to say the numbers \"one\", \"two\", and \"three\". We assumed you would know to start with \"one\" and end with \"three\". With programming, we need to be more explicit with our directions to the computer. Here's how we might tell the computer to \"count to three\":\n\n```js\nfor (let i = 1; i \u003c= 3; i++) {\n  console.log(i);\n}\n```\n\nWhen we speak to other humans, we share a vocabulary that provides quick ways to communicate complicated concepts. When we say the word \"bake\", it calls to mind a familiar subroutine\u0026mdash; preheating an oven, putting something into an oven for a set amount of time, and finally removing it. This allows us to _abstract_ away a lot of the details and communicate key concepts more concisely. Instead of listing all those details, we can say, \"We baked a cake,\" and still impart all that meaning to you. \n\nIn this lesson, we'll learn how to use “abstraction” in programming by writing functions. In addition to allowing us to reuse our code, functions help to make clear, readable programs. If you encounter `countToThree()` in a program, you might be able to quickly guess what the function does without having to stop and read the function's body. \n\nWe're also going to learn about a way to add another level of abstraction to our programming: _higher-order functions_.  _Higher-order functions_ are functions that accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output. This enables us to build abstractions on other abstractions, just like \"We hosted a birthday party\" is an abstraction that may build on the abstraction \"We made a cake.\"","instructions":"Using abstraction allows us to write more modular code, which is easier to read and debug.

With callback functions, we pass in the function itself by typing the function name _without_ the parentheses:\n\n\n\n```js\nconst higherOrderFunc = param =\u003e {\n  param();\n  return `I just invoked ${param.name} as a callback function!`\n}\n \nconst anotherFunc = () =\u003e {\n  return 'I\\'m being invoked by the higher-order function!';\n}\n\nhigherOrderFunc(anotherFunc);\n```\n\nWe wrote a higher-order function `higherOrderFunc` that accepts a single parameter, `param`. Inside the body, `param` gets invoked using parentheses. And finally, a string is returned, telling us the name of the callback function that was passed in.\n\nBelow the higher-order function, we have another function aptly named `anotherFunc`. This function aspires to be called inside the higher-order function.\n\nLastly, we invoke `higherOrderFunc()`, passing in `anotherFunc` as its argument, thus fulfilling its dreams of being called by the higher-order function.\n\n```js\nhigherOrderFunc(() =\u003e {\n  for (let i = 0; i \u003c= 10; i++){\n    console.log(i);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we invoked `higherOrderFunc()` with an [anonymous function](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/functions/exercises/function-expressions) (a function without a name) that counts to 10. Anonymous functions can be arguments too!\n\nLet’s get some practice writing higher-order functions.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc21","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null}]},"13ad39262619c577db0c8a5fa08fe212":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"13ad39262619c577db0c8a5fa08fe212","sourceId":null,"title":"Review","slug":"review","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:14:16Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node-14","server":null},"last_modified_at":"2020-05-27T18:52:02Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ef0e0a21dde1c00126fe11d","slug":"higher-order-functions-functions-as-parameters-revised","type":"node-14"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.1},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc28","type":"Narrative","content":"Great job!

Let's explore the syntax of invoking `.forEach()`. \n* `groceries.forEach()` calls the `forEach` method on the `groceries` array. \n* `.forEach()` takes an argument of callback function. Remember, a callback function is a function passed as an argument into another function. \n* `.forEach()` loops through the array and executes the callback function for each element. During each execution, the current element is passed as an argument to the callback function.\n* The return value for `.forEach()` will always be `undefined`.\n\nAnother way to pass a callback for `.forEach()` is to use arrow function syntax. \n```js\ngroceries.forEach(groceryItem =\u003e console.log(groceryItem));\n```\n\nWe can also define a function beforehand to be used as the callback function.\n```js\nfunction printGrocery(element){\n  console.log(element);\n}\n\ngroceries.forEach(printGrocery);\n```\nThe above example uses a function declaration but you can also use a function expression or arrow function as well. \n\nAll three code snippets do the same thing. In each array iteration method, we can use any of the three examples to supply a callback function as an argument to the iterator. It's good to be aware of the different ways to pass in callback functions as arguments in iterators because developers have different stylistic preferences. Nonetheless, due to the strong adoption of ES6, we will be using arrow function syntax in the later exercises. \n\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a1639026b","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a1639026a","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null}]},"ec22cff017452ee3112d55d357864059":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"ec22cff017452ee3112d55d357864059","sourceId":null,"title":"The .map() Method","slug":"map","published":true,"setup_command":"","created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390273","instructions":"Add your code under the `animals` array and before the line `console.log(secretMessage.join(''));` \n\nUse `.map()` to create a new array that contains the first character of each string in the `animals` array.

The callback function for the `.filter()` method should return `true` or `false` depending on the element that is passed to it. The elements that cause the callback function to return `true` are added to the new array.

The [`.reduce()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays/reduce?page_ref=catalog) method returns a single value after iterating through the elements of an array, thereby _reducing_ the array.  Take a look at the example below:\n\n```js\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 4, 10];\n\nconst summedNums = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) =\u003e {\n  return accumulator + currentValue\n})\n\nconsole.log(summedNums) // Output: 17\n```\nHere are the values of `accumulator` and `currentValue` as we iterate through the `numbers` array: \n\u003cdiv class=\"narrative-table-container\"\u003e\n\n| Iteration |`accumulator` |`currentValue` |return value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First | 1 | 2 | 3\n| Second | 3 | 4 | 7\n| Third | 7 | 10 | 17\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow let's go over the use of `.reduce()` from the example above: \n* `numbers` is an array that contains numbers. \n* `summedNums` is a variable that stores the returned value of invoking `.reduce()` on `numbers`. \n* `numbers.reduce()` calls the `.reduce()` method on the `numbers` array and takes in a callback function as argument. \n* The callback function has two parameters, `accumulator` and `currentValue`. The value of `accumulator` starts off as the value of the first element in the array and the `currentValue` starts as the second element. To see the value of `accumulator` and `currentValue` change, review the chart above. \n* As `.reduce()` iterates through the array, the return value of the callback function becomes the `accumulator` value for the next iteration, `currentValue` takes on the value of the current element in the looping process. \n\nThe `.reduce()` method can also take  an optional second parameter to set an initial value for `accumulator` (remember, the first argument is the callback function!).  For instance: \n\n```js\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 4, 10];\n\nconst summedNums = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) =\u003e {\n  return accumulator + currentValue\n}, 100)  // \u003c- Second argument for .reduce()\n\nconsole.log(summedNums); // Output: 117\n```\nHere's an updated chart that accounts for the second argument of `100`: \n\u003cdiv class=\"narrative-table-container\"\u003e\n\n| Iteration # |`accumulator` |`currentValue` |return value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First | 100 | 1 | 101\n| Second | 101 | 2 | 103\n| Third | 103 | 4 | 107\n| Fourth | 107 | 10 | 117\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390281","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390282","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},"17735007ebeff1004ea04ba83bdd0469":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"17735007ebeff1004ea04ba83bdd0469","sourceId":null,"title":"Iterator Documentation","slug":"documentation","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a1639028e","instructions":"In the code editor, there is an array called `words`.

It returns `-1` if none of the elements in the array satisfies the condition. \n* `.reduce()` iterates through an array and takes the values of the elements and returns a single value. \n* All iterator methods take a callback function, which can be a pre-defined function, a function expression, or an arrow function.\n* You can visit the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMozilla Developer Network\u003c/a\u003e to learn more about iterator methods (and all other parts of JavaScript!). \n\n","instructions":"If you want to challenge yourself:\n* Define a callback function before you use it in a iterator. \n* Chain two iteration methods on the same array. \n* Use the optional arguments in an iterator to include the index or the entire array.

One way to give computers these instructions is with a [`for` loop](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/loops?page_ref=catalog). \n\nThe typical `for` loop includes an _iterator variable_ that usually appears in all three expressions. The iterator variable is initialized, checked against the stopping condition, and assigned a new value on each loop iteration. Iterator variables can have any name, but it’s best practice to use a descriptive variable name.\n\nA `for` loop contains three expressions separated by `;` inside the parentheses: \n1. an _initialization_ starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.\n2. a _stopping condition_ is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated against\u0026mdash; if the condition evaluates to `true` the code block will run, and if it evaluates to `false` the code will stop.\n3. an _iteration statement_ is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.\n\nThe `for` loop syntax looks like this:\n```js\nfor (let counter = 0; counter \u003c 4; counter++) {\n  console.log(counter);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the output would be the following:\n```\n0\n1\n2\n3\n```\n\nLet’s break down the example:\n* The initialization is `let counter = 0`, so the loop will start counting at `0`.\n* The stopping condition is `counter \u003c 4`, meaning the loop will run as long as the iterator variable, `counter`, is less than 4.\n* The iteration statement is `counter++`. This means after each loop, the value of `counter` will increase by 1. For the first iteration `counter` will equal `0`, for the second iteration `counter` will equal 1, and so on.\n* The code block is inside of the curly braces, `console.log(counter)`, will execute until the condition evaluates to `false`. The condition will be false when `counter` is greater than or equal to 4 \u0026mdash; the point that the condition becomes false is sometimes called the _stop condition_.\n\nThis `for` loop makes it possible to write `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` programmatically.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae26a","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae269","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null}]},"c29fa351e15793999c178f2afd90e2ad":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"c29fa351e15793999c178f2afd90e2ad","sourceId":null,"title":"Looping in Reverse","slug":"for-loop-ii","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae272","instructions":"Make a `for` loop that loops backwards printing `3` to `0` to the console.

For example, we can use a `for` loop to perform the same operation on each element on an array.

Imagine we owned a store and wanted to increase the price of every product in our catalog. That could be a lot of repeating code, but by using a `for` loop to iterate through the array we could accomplish this task easily. \n\nTo loop through each element in an array, a `for` loop should use the array's `.length` property in its condition. \n\nCheck out the example below to see how `for` loops iterate on arrays:\n```js\nconst animals = ['Grizzly Bear', 'Sloth', 'Sea Lion'];\nfor (let i = 0; i \u003c animals.length; i++){\n  console.log(animals[i]);\n}\n```\n\nThis example would give you the following output:\n```\nGrizzly Bear\nSloth\nSea Lion\n```\nIn the loop above, we've named our iterator variable `i`. This is a variable naming convention you'll see in a lot of loops. When we use `i` to iterate through arrays we can think of it as being short-hand for the word **i**ndex. Notice how our stopping condition checks that `i` is less than `animals.length`. Remember that arrays are zero-indexed, the index of the last element of an array is equivalent to the length of that array minus 1.

We're going to teach you about a different type of loop: the [`while` loop](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/loops?page_ref=catalog). To start, let's convert a `for` loop into a `while` loop:\n```js\n// A for loop that prints 1, 2, and 3\nfor (let counterOne = 1; counterOne \u003c 4; counterOne++){\n  console.log(counterOne);\n}\n\n// A while loop that prints 1, 2, and 3\nlet counterTwo = 1;\nwhile (counterTwo \u003c 4) {\n  console.log(counterTwo);\n  counterTwo++;\n}\n```\nLet's break down what's happening with our `while` loop syntax: \n- The `counterTwo` variable is declared before the loop. We can access it inside our `while` loop since it's in the global scope. \n- We start our loop with the keyword `while` followed by our stopping condition, or _test condition_. This will be evaluated before each round of the loop. While the condition evaluates to `true`, the block will continue to run. Once it evaluates to `false` the loop will stop. \n- Next, we have our loop's code block which prints `counterTwo` to the console and increments `counterTwo`. \n\nWhat would happen if we didn't increment `counterTwo` inside our block? If we didn't include this, `counterTwo` would always have its initial value, `1`. That would mean the testing condition `counterTwo \u003c 4` would always evaluate to `true` and our loop would never stop running! Remember, this is called an _infinite loop_ and it's something we always want to **avoid**. Infinite loops can take up all of your computer's processing power potentially freezing your computer. \n\nSo you may be wondering when to use a `while` loop! The syntax of a `while` loop is ideal when we don’t know in advance how many times the loop should run. Think of eating like a `while` loop: when you start taking bites, you don't know the exact number you'll need to become full. Rather you'll eat `while` you're hungry. In situations when we want a loop to execute an undetermined number of times, `while` loops are the best choice.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae280","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null}]},"5ff652197775cc38ceb58babcaa6fba1":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"5ff652197775cc38ceb58babcaa6fba1","sourceId":null,"title":"Do...While Statements","slug":"do-while-statement","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae28b","instructions":"We'd like a program to simulate part of the cake-baking process.

These methods are specifically called on arrays to make common tasks, like adding and removing elements, more straightforward. \n\nOne method, [`.push()`,](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays/push?page_ref=catalog) allows us to add items to the end of an array. Here is an example of how this is used:\n\n```js\nconst itemTracker = ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2'];\n\nitemTracker.push('item 3', 'item 4');\n\nconsole.log(itemTracker); \n// Output: ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3', 'item 4'];\n```\nSo, how does `.push()` work? \n\n* We access the `push` method by using dot notation, connecting `push` to `itemTracker` with a period. \n* Then we call it like a function. That's because `.push()` is a function and one that JavaScript allows us to use right on an array. \n* `.push()` can take a single argument or multiple arguments separated by commas. In this case, we're adding two elements: `'item 3'` and `'item 4'` to `itemTracker`.\n* Notice that `.push()` changes, or _mutates_, `itemTracker`. You might also see `.push()` referred to as a _destructive_ array method since it changes the initial array.\n\nIf you're looking for a method that will mutate an array by adding elements to it, then `.push()` is the method for you!

Well what happens if we try to change an array inside a function? Does the array keep the change after the function call or is it scoped to inside the function?\n\nTake a look at the following example where we call `.push()` on an array inside a function. Recall, the `.push()` method mutates, or changes, an array:\n```js\nconst flowers = ['peony', 'daffodil', 'marigold'];\n\nfunction addFlower(arr) {\n  arr.push('lily');\n}\n\naddFlower(flowers);\n\nconsole.log(flowers); // Output: ['peony', 'daffodil', 'marigold', 'lily']\n```\nLet's go over what happened in the example:\n* The `flowers` array that has 3 elements. \n* The function `addFlower()` has a parameter of `arr` uses `.push()` to add a `'lily'` element into `arr`.\n* We call `addFlower()` with an argument of `flowers` which will execute the code inside `addFlower`.\n* We check the value of `flowers` and it now includes the `'lily'` element! The array was mutated! \n\nSo when you pass an array into a function, if the array is mutated inside the function, that change will be maintained outside the function as well. You might also see this concept explained as _pass-by-reference_ since what we're actually passing to the function is a reference to where the variable memory is stored and changing the memory. \n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fcf","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd0","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},"9f2ea421b8bbf0d5cd88d37ea9e88129":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"9f2ea421b8bbf0d5cd88d37ea9e88129","sourceId":null,"title":"Nested Arrays","slug":"nested-arrays","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fdb","instructions":"Let's make a nested array!

In this lesson, we learned these concepts regarding arrays:\n\n* Arrays are lists that store data in JavaScript. \n* Arrays are created with brackets `[]`.\n* Each item inside of an array is at a numbered position, or index, starting at `0`. \n* We can access one item in an array using its index, with syntax like: `myArray[0]`.\n* We can also change an item in an array using its index, with syntax like `myArray[0] = 'new string'`; \n* Arrays have a `length` property, which allows you to see how many items are in an array.\n* Arrays have their own methods, including `.push()` and `.pop()`, which add and remove items from an array, respectively.\n* Arrays have many methods that perform different tasks, such as `.slice()` and `.shift()`, you can find documentation at the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMozilla Developer Network\u003c/a\u003e website. \n* Some built-in methods are mutating, meaning the method will change the array, while others are not mutating. You can always check the documentation.  \n* Variables that contain arrays can be declared with `let` or `const`. Even when declared with `const`, arrays are still mutable. However, a variable declared with `const` cannot be reassigned. \n* Arrays mutated inside of a function will keep that change even outside the function. \n* Arrays can be nested inside other arrays. \n* To access elements in nested arrays chain indices using bracket notation. \n\nLearning how to work with and manipulate arrays will help you work with chunks of data! \n","instructions":"Looking for more ways to practice?

Everyone who lives on the planet Earth is in the global scope of the stars. The stars are accessible _globally_. Meanwhile, if you live in a city, you may see the city skyline or the river. The skyline and river are only accessible _locally_ in your city, but you can still see the stars that are available globally.\n\nOver the next few exercises, we'll explore how scope relates to variables and learn best practices for variable declaration.

Here we assign a new value to the variable `color` if the `if` statement is truthy.\n- Within the `if` block, the `color` variable holds the value `'pink'`, though outside the `if` block, in the function body, the `color` variable holds the value `'blue'`.\n- On the last line, we attempt to print the value of `color` outside both the `if` statement and the definition of `logSkyColor()`. This will throw a `ReferenceError` since `color` only exists within the scope of those two blocks \u0026mdash; it is never defined in the global scope.\n- While we use block scope, we still pollute our namespace by reusing the same variable name twice. A better practice would be to rename the variable inside the block.\n\nBlock scope is a powerful tool in JavaScript, since it allows us to define variables with precision, and not pollute the global namespace.

Instead of rewriting the same code, we can group a block of code together and associate it with one task, then we can reuse that block of code whenever we need to perform the task again. We achieve this by creating a _function_.

One way to create a function is by using a _function declaration_. Just like how a variable declaration binds a value to a variable name, a function declaration binds a function to a name, or an _identifier_.\nTake a look at the anatomy of a function declaration below:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/declaration.svg\" alt=\"Diagram showing the syntax of a function declaration\"\u003e\n\nA function declaration consists of: \n* The `function` keyword.\n* The name of the function, or its identifier, followed by parentheses.\n* A function body, or the block of statements required to perform a specific task, enclosed in the function’s curly brackets, `{ }`.\n\nA function declaration is a function that is bound to an identifier, or name. In the next exercise we'll go over how to run the code inside the function body. \n\nWe should also be aware of the _hoisting_ feature in JavaScript which allows access to function declarations before they're defined. \n\nTake a look at example of hoisting:\n```js\ngreetWorld(); // Output: Hello, World!\n\nfunction greetWorld() {\n  console.log('Hello, World!');\n}\n```\n\nNotice how hoisting allowed `greetWorld()` to be called before the `greetWorld()` function was defined! Since hoisting isn't considered good practice, we simply want you to be aware of this feature.\n\nIf you want to read more about hoisting, check out \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN documentation on hoisting\u003c/a\u003e. \n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a45e","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a45d","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},"518f76047e7387f9211831dfc3e04f49":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"518f76047e7387f9211831dfc3e04f49","sourceId":null,"title":"Calling a Function","slug":"functions","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a469","instructions":"Imagine that you manage an online store.

However, if a function takes zero or multiple parameters, parentheses are required.\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/parameters.svg\" alt=\"showcasing how arrow functions parameters differ for different amounts of parameters\"\u003e\n\n2. A function body composed of a single-line block does not need curly braces. Without the curly braces, whatever that line evaluates will be automatically returned. The contents of the block should immediately follow the arrow `=\u003e` and the `return` keyword can be removed. This is referred to as _implicit return_.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/return.svg\" alt=\"comparing single line and multiline arrow functions\"\u003e\n\nSo if we have a function:\n```js\nconst squareNum = (num) =\u003e {\n  return num * num;\n};\n```\nWe can refactor the function to:\n\n```js\nconst squareNum = num =\u003e num * num;\n```\n\nNotice the following changes:\n\n* The parentheses around `num`  have been removed, since it has a single parameter.\n* The curly braces `{  }` have been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.\n* The `return` keyword has been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.\n\n\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a497","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},"354a6080b6cd0792826466040785e22f":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"354a6080b6cd0792826466040785e22f","sourceId":null,"title":"Review Functions","slug":"review-functions","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2020-05-18T20:58:08Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ef0d7ba526f050012810fdb","slug":"learn-javascript-functions-functions-review","type":"node"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.9},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a49b","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a49d","type":"Narrative","content":"Give yourself a pat on the back, you just navigated through functions! \n\nIn this lesson, we covered some important concepts about functions: \n\n\n* A _function_ is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.\n\n* A _function declaration_ :\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/declaration.svg\" alt=\"Diagram showing the syntax of a function declaration\"\u003e\n\n\n* A parameter is a named variable inside a function's block which will be assigned the value of the argument passed in when the function is invoked:\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/function_parameters.svg\" alt=\"JavaScript syntax for declaring a function with parameters\"\u003e\n\n* To _call_ a function in your code:\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/name.svg\" alt=\"Diagram showing the syntax of invoking a function\"\u003e\n\n* ES6 introduces new ways of handling arbitrary parameters through _default parameters_ which allow us to assign a default value to a parameter in case no argument is passed into the function.\n\n* To return a value from a function, we use a _return statement_. \n\n* To define a function using _function expressions_:\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/expression.svg\" alt=\"defining a function expression\"\u003e\n\n* To define a function using _arrow function notation_:\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/arrow_notation.svg\" alt=\"\"\u003e \n\n* Function definition can be made concise using concise arrow notation:\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/return.svg\" alt=\"comparing single line and multiline arrow functions\"\u003e\n\nIt's good to be aware of the differences between function expressions, arrow functions, and function declarations.

When the answer is \"yes\", the statement evaluates to `true`, and when the answer is \"no\", the statement evaluates to `false`. The code above would be asking: is 10 less than 12? Yes!

In JavaScript, there are operators that work with boolean values known as _logical operators_. We can use logical operators to add more sophisticated logic to our conditionals. There are three logical operators:\n* the  _and_ operator (`\u0026\u0026`)\n* the _or_ operator (`||`)\n* the _not_ operator, otherwise known as the _bang_ operator (`!`)\n\n\nWhen we use the `\u0026\u0026` operator, we are checking that two things are `true`: \n```js\nif (stopLight === 'green' \u0026\u0026 pedestrians === 0) {\n  console.log('Go!');\n} else {\n  console.log('Stop');\n}\n```\nWhen using the `\u0026\u0026` operator, both conditions *must* evaluate to `true` for the entire condition to evaluate to `true` and execute. Otherwise, if either condition is `false`, the `\u0026\u0026` condition will evaluate to `false` and the `else` block will execute. \n\nIf we only care about either condition being `true`, we can use the `||` operator:\n```js\nif (day === 'Saturday' || day === 'Sunday') {\n  console.log('Enjoy the weekend!');\n} else {\n  console.log('Do some work.');\n}\n```\nWhen using the `||` operator, only one of the conditions must evaluate to `true` for the overall statement to evaluate to `true`. In the code example above, if either `day === 'Saturday'` or `day === 'Sunday'` evaluates to `true` the `if`'s condition will evaluate to `true` and its code block will execute. If the first condition in an `||` statement evaluates to `true`, the second condition won't even be checked. Only if `day === 'Saturday'` evaluates to `false` will `day === 'Sunday'` be evaluated. The code in the `else` statement above will execute only if both comparisons evaluate to `false`.\n\nThe `!` _not operator_ reverses, or _negates_, the value of a boolean:\n```js\nlet excited = true;\nconsole.log(!excited); // Prints false\n\nlet sleepy = false;\nconsole.log(!sleepy); // Prints true\n```\nEssentially, the `!` operator will either take a `true` value and pass back `false`, or it will take a `false` value and pass back `true`. \n\nLogical operators are often used in conditional statements to add another layer of logic to our code.

A `switch` statement looks like this:\n\n```js\nlet groceryItem = 'papaya';\n\nswitch (groceryItem) {\n  case 'tomato':\n    console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');\n    break;\n  case 'lime':\n    console.log('Limes are $1.49');\n    break;\n  case 'papaya':\n    console.log('Papayas are $1.29');\n    break;\n  default:\n    console.log('Invalid item');\n    break;\n}\n\n// Prints 'Papayas are $1.29'\n```\n\n* The `switch` keyword initiates the statement and is followed by `( ... )`, which contains the value that each `case` will compare. In the example, the value or expression of the `switch` statement is `groceryItem`.\n* Inside the block, `{ ... }`, there are multiple `case`s. The `case` keyword checks if the expression matches the specified value that comes after it. The value following the first `case` is `'tomato'`. If the value of `groceryItem` equalled `'tomato'`, that `case`'s `console.log()` would run.\n* The value of `groceryItem` is `'papaya'`, so the third `case` runs\u0026mdash; `Papayas are $1.29` is logged to the console.\n* The `break` keyword tells the computer to exit the block and not execute any more code or check any other cases inside the code block. Note: Without `break` keywords, the first matching case will run, but so will every subsequent case regardless of whether or not it matches—including the default. This behavior is different from `if`/`else` conditional statements that execute only one block of code. \n* At the end of each `switch` statement, there is a `default` statement. If none of the `case`s are true, then the code in the `default` statement will run.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a3","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a2","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null}]},"1bd8e532511877c26294a58104637186":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"1bd8e532511877c26294a58104637186","sourceId":null,"title":"Review","slug":"review-control-flow","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2020-02-29T22:54:48Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ea9d240a69948001117fd98","slug":"learn-javascript-conditionals-review","type":"node"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.25},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf3906ab","type":"Narrative","content":"Way to go!

In JavaScript, there are eight fundamental data types:\n\n- _Number_: Any number, including numbers with decimals: `4`, `8`, `1516`, `23.42`.\n- _BigInt_: Any number, greater than 2\u003csup\u003e53\u003c/sup\u003e-1 or less than -(2\u003csup\u003e53\u003c/sup\u003e-1), with n appended to the number: 1234567890123456n.\n- _String_: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: `' ... '` or double quotes `\" ... \"`, though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.\n- _Boolean_: This data type only has two possible values\u0026mdash; either `true` or `false` (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a \"yes\" or \"no\" question.\n- _Null_:  This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword `null` (without quotes).\n- _Undefined_: This data type is denoted by the keyword `undefined` (without quotes).  It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than `null`. `undefined` means that a given value does not exist.\n- _Symbol_: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.\n- _Object_: Collections of related data.\n\nThe first 7 of those types are considered _primitive data types_. They are the most basic data types in the language. _Objects_ are more complex, and you’ll learn much more about them as you progress through JavaScript. At first, eight types may not seem like that many, but soon you’ll observe the world opens with possibilities once you start leveraging each one. As you learn more about objects, you’ll be able to create complex collections of data.\n\nBut before we do that, let's get comfortable with strings and numbers!\n\n```js\nconsole.log('Location of Codecademy headquarters: 575 Broadway, New York City');\nconsole.log(40);\n```\nIn the example above, we first printed a string. Our string isn't just a single word; it includes both capital and lowercase letters, spaces, and punctuation.\n\nNext, we printed the number 40, notice we did not use quotes.

Let's call the `.random()` method from the built-in `Math` object:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(Math.random()); // Prints a random number between 0 and 1\n```\nIn the example above, we called the `.random()` method by appending the object name with the dot operator, the name of the method, and opening and closing parentheses. This method returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). \n\nTo generate a random number between 0 and 50, we could multiply this result by 50, like so: \n\n```js\nMath.random() * 50;\n```\n\nThe example above will likely evaluate to a decimal. To ensure the answer is a whole number, we can take advantage of another useful `Math` method called `Math.floor()`. \n\n`Math.floor()` takes a decimal number, and rounds down to the nearest whole number. You can use `Math.floor()` to round down a random number like this:\n\n```js\nMath.floor(Math.random() * 50);\n```\nIn this case:\n1. `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1.\n2. We then multiply that number by `50`, so now we have a number between 0 and 50.\n3. Then, `Math.floor()` rounds the number down to the nearest whole number.\n\nIf you wanted to see the number printed to the terminal, you would still need to use a `console.log()` statement:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 50)); // Prints a random whole number between 0 and 50\n```\n\nTo see all of the properties and methods on the `Math` object, take a look at \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"\u003ethe documentation here\u003c/a\u003e.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439053e","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439053f","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},"fae7954a45c3b36d14388b06132b5699":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"fae7954a45c3b36d14388b06132b5699","sourceId":null,"title":"Review","slug":"review","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:24Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2020-02-29T22:53:45Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ea9d21b6c7a070012b09a7e","slug":"introduction-to-javascript-review-types-operators","type":"node"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.7},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390548","type":"Narrative","content":"Let's take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:\n\n- Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with `console.log()`.\n- We can write single-line comments with `//` and multi-line comments between `/*` and `*/`.\n- There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.\n- Numbers are any number without quotes: `23.8879`\n- Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: `'Sample String'`\n- The built-in arithmetic operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.\n- Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a `.` after the name of the object, for example: `'Hello'.length`. \n- Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions.

One of the biggest changes was two new keywords, `let` and `const`, to create, or _declare_, variables. Prior to the ES6, programmers could only use the `var` keyword to declare variables. \n\n```js\nvar myName = 'Arya';\nconsole.log(myName);\n// Output: Arya\n```\n\nLet's consider the example above:\n\n1. `var`, short for variable, is a JavaScript _keyword_ that creates, or _declares_, a new variable.\n2. `myName` is the variable's name. Capitalizing in this way is a standard convention in JavaScript called _camel casing_. In camel casing you group words into one, the first word is lowercase, then every word that follows will have its first letter uppercased. (e.g. camelCaseEverything). \n3. `=` is the _assignment operator_. It assigns the value (`'Arya'`) to the variable (`myName`). \n4. `'Arya'` is the _value_ assigned (`=`) to the variable `myName`. You can also say that the `myName` variable is _initialized_ with a value of `'Arya'`. \n5. After the variable is declared, the string value `'Arya'` is printed to the console by referencing the variable name: `console.log(myName)`. \n\nThere are a few general rules for naming variables: \n* Variable names cannot start with numbers. \n* Variable names are case sensitive, so `myName` and `myname` would be different variables. It is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.\n* Variable names cannot be the same as _keywords_. For a comprehensive list of keywords check out \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN's keyword documentation\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nIn the next exercises, we will learn why ES6's `let` and `const` are the preferred variable keywords by many programmers. Because there is still a ton of code written prior to ES6, it's helpful to be familiar with the pre-ES6 `var` keyword.\n\nIf you want to learn more about `var` and the quirks associated with it, check out the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN var documentation\u003c/a\u003e.\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054e","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054d","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null}]},"d06e3f20637a377ff7e95603af7853e5":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"d06e3f20637a377ff7e95603af7853e5","sourceId":null,"title":"Create a Variable: let","slug":"let","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:24Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390558","instructions":"Create a `let` variable called `changeMe` and set it equal to the boolean `true`.","hint":"To create a variable using the `let` keyword, first add `let` followed by the name of the variable and use the `=` operator to assign it a value. \n```js\nlet thisVariable = false;\n```\n","test_type":"mochaTest","test_code":"console.log = function() {};\nconst { assert } = require('chai');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst Structured = require('structured');\n\nconst code = fs.readFileSync('main.js', 'utf8');\n\ndescribe('', function () {\n  it('', function() {\n    let structureOne = function() {\n      let changeMe = true\n    };\n\n    let isMatchOne = Structured.match(code, structureOne);\n\n    assert.isOk(isMatchOne, 'Did you declare a variable named `changeMe` using the `let` keyword and assign `changeMe` a value of `true`?');\n  });\n});\n","test_options":{"withBabel":false}},{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390559","instructions":"On the line after `changeMe` is declared, set the value of `changeMe` to be the boolean `false`.\n\nTo check if `changeMe` was reassigned, log the value saved to `changeMe` to the console.\n","hint":"In the example below, the variable `thisVariable` is first set to the value `44` then changed to `'I am a string'`.\n```js\nlet thisVariable = 44;\nthisVariable = 'I am a string';\n```","test_type":"mochaTest","test_code":"console.log = function() {};\nvar rewire = require('rewire'),\n    appModule = rewire('../main.js');\nconst { assert, expect } = require('chai');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst Structured = require('structured');\n\nconst code = fs.readFileSync('main.js', 'utf8');\n\ndescribe('', function () {\n  it('', function() {\n    const changeMe = appModule.__get__('changeMe')\n  \texpect(changeMe, 'Did you create a variable named `changeMe`?').to.exist;\n    expect(changeMe, 'Did you set `changeMe` to `false`?').to.eql(false);\n  });\n\n  it('', function() {\n    let structureOne = function() {\n      console.log(changeMe);\n    };\n\n    let isMatchOne = Structured.match(code, structureOne)\n\n    assert.isOk(isMatchOne, 'Did you `console.log()` `changeMe`?')\n  });\n});\n","test_options":{"withBabel":true}}],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2020-04-27T20:33:04Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ef0cb026eebaa00122169d1","slug":"learn-javascript-variables-letV2","type":"node"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":6.183333},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390555","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390556","type":"Narrative","content":"As mentioned in the previous exercise, the `let` keyword was introduced in ES6.

We're performing the mathematical operation of the first operator `+` using the number to the right, then reassigning `w` to the computed value. \n\nWe also have access to other mathematical assignment operators: `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` which work in a similar fashion. \n\n```js\nlet x = 20;\nx -= 5; // Can be written as x = x - 5\nconsole.log(x); // Output: 15\n\nlet y = 50;\ny *= 2; // Can be written as y = y * 2\nconsole.log(y); // Output: 100\n\nlet z = 8;\nz /= 2; // Can be written as z = z / 2\nconsole.log(z); // Output: 4\n```\nLet's practice using these mathematical assignment operators!

Read this article to read and find out! ","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"javascript-versions","title":"JavaScript Versions: ES6 and Before","time":5,"type":"article","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"body":"You might have seen the term \"ES6\" or \"JavaScript ES6\"  and wondered what it actually means. Well wonder no further, because we're going to dive into what ES6 is and how it relates to JavaScript! \n\nFirst, let's bring in some history. JavaScript was introduced in 1995 by the company Netscape Communications as a scripting language for web designers and programmers to interact with web pages. The next year,  Netscape submitted JavaScript to a standards developing organization called Ecma International to create standards for a scripting language (a type of programming language). In 1997, Ecma International released ECMA-262 which sets standards for the first version of a scripting language called ECMAScript, shortened to ES. \n\nThese new ECMAScript standards provided rules for the architecture of JavaScript features. As new programming paradigms emerged and developers sought new features, newer versions of ECMAScript provided a basis for consistency between new and old JavaScript versions. \n\nTo fully distinguish the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript: if you want to create an app or program you can use JavaScript \u0026mdash; if you want to create a new scripting language you can follow the guidelines in ECMAScript. So, when you see ES6 or JavaScript ES6, it means that that version of JavaScript is following the specifications in the sixth edition of ECMAScript! You might also see ES2015 instead of ES6, but both terminologies are referring to the same 6th edition of ECMAScript that was released in 2015. Take a look at the timeline below to see how JavaScript has evolved over the years:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-article-assets/javascript_timeline.svg\" alt=\"Timeline showing the evolution of JS editions from inception to 2018\"\u003e\n\nNow, you may be asking, what makes an update in 2015 still relevant today when there are more recent updates like ES7 and ES8? \n\nWell, despite the release of newer versions, ES6 is actually the biggest update made to ECMAScript since the first edition released in 1997! Some developers even refer to ES6 as \"Modern JavaScript\" because of all the major additions. There were so many great features added to help JavaScript developers that include: \n* new keywords like `let` and `const` to declare variables\n* new function syntax using Arrow functions\n* creation of Classes\n* parameters with default values\n* promises for asynchronous actions\n* and many more!\n\n\nUp-to-date browsers now support most of the ES6 features which allow developers to take advantage of these new additions. ES6 ultimately allows programmers to save time and write more concise code. Take for example pre-ES6 syntax for function expressions:\n```js\nvar greeting = function() {\n  console.log('Hello World!');  \n};\n```\nWith ES6 arrow functions, we can transform the expression above into: \n\n```js\nconst greeting = () =\u003e console.log('Hello World'); \n```\nHowever, arrow functions are not just simply syntactical re-writes. As with other ES6 features, there are other underlying benefits and tradeoffs to consider. Nonetheless, there has been a strong adoption of ES6 in the development community. Benefits such as new ES6 syntax, make it easier to utilize a popular programming paradigm, Object Oriented Programming (OOP). With this change, developers in other languages who are used to OOP have a smoother transition into learning and using JavaScript. Another reason for the popularity of ES6 is correlated with the usage of ES6 in popular frameworks like React.  So, if you want to learn the newest tools and frameworks, you will have to pick up ES6 along the way.  \n\nThis being said, we shouldn’t disregard legacy code, i.e. older versions of JavaScript. In fact, there are still many projects that are built and maintained with legacy code! If you want the ability and freedom to work on any sort of JavaScript project, you should familiarize yourself with pre-ES6 and ES6 JavaScript syntax. But don't worry, we cover both pre-ES6 and ES6 in our JavaScript course.

One of the biggest changes was two new keywords, `let` and `const`, to create, or _declare_, variables. Prior to the ES6, programmers could only use the `var` keyword to declare variables. \n\n```js\nvar myName = 'Arya';\nconsole.log(myName);\n// Output: Arya\n```\n\nLet's consider the example above:\n\n1. `var`, short for variable, is a JavaScript _keyword_ that creates, or _declares_, a new variable.\n2. `myName` is the variable's name. Capitalizing in this way is a standard convention in JavaScript called _camel casing_. In camel casing you group words into one, the first word is lowercase, then every word that follows will have its first letter uppercased. (e.g. camelCaseEverything). \n3. `=` is the _assignment operator_. It assigns the value (`'Arya'`) to the variable (`myName`). \n4. `'Arya'` is the _value_ assigned (`=`) to the variable `myName`. You can also say that the `myName` variable is _initialized_ with a value of `'Arya'`. \n5. After the variable is declared, the string value `'Arya'` is printed to the console by referencing the variable name: `console.log(myName)`. \n\nThere are a few general rules for naming variables: \n* Variable names cannot start with numbers. \n* Variable names are case sensitive, so `myName` and `myname` would be different variables. It is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.\n* Variable names cannot be the same as _keywords_. For a comprehensive list of keywords check out \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN's keyword documentation\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nIn the next exercises, we will learn why ES6's `let` and `const` are the preferred variable keywords by many programmers. Because there is still a ton of code written prior to ES6, it's helpful to be familiar with the pre-ES6 `var` keyword.\n\nIf you want to learn more about `var` and the quirks associated with it, check out the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN var documentation\u003c/a\u003e.\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054e","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054d","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"d06e3f20637a377ff7e95603af7853e5","sourceId":null,"title":"Create a Variable: let","slug":"let","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:24Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390558","instructions":"Create a `let` variable called `changeMe` and set it equal to the boolean `true`.","hint":"To create a variable using the `let` keyword, first add `let` followed by the name of the variable and use the `=` operator to assign it a value. \n```js\nlet thisVariable = false;\n```\n","test_type":"mochaTest","test_code":"console.log = function() {};\nconst { assert } = require('chai');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst Structured = require('structured');\n\nconst code = fs.readFileSync('main.js', 'utf8');\n\ndescribe('', function () {\n  it('', function() {\n    let structureOne = function() {\n      let changeMe = true\n    };\n\n    let isMatchOne = Structured.match(code, structureOne);\n\n    assert.isOk(isMatchOne, 'Did you declare a variable named `changeMe` using the `let` keyword and assign `changeMe` a value of `true`?');\n  });\n});\n","test_options":{"withBabel":false}},{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390559","instructions":"On the line after `changeMe` is declared, set the value of `changeMe` to be the boolean `false`.\n\nTo check if `changeMe` was reassigned, log the value saved to `changeMe` to the console.\n","hint":"In the example below, the variable `thisVariable` is first set to the value `44` then changed to `'I am a string'`.\n```js\nlet thisVariable = 44;\nthisVariable = 'I am a string';\n```","test_type":"mochaTest","test_code":"console.log = function() {};\nvar rewire = require('rewire'),\n    appModule = rewire('../main.js');\nconst { assert, expect } = require('chai');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst Structured = require('structured');\n\nconst code = fs.readFileSync('main.js', 'utf8');\n\ndescribe('', function () {\n  it('', function() {\n    const changeMe = appModule.__get__('changeMe')\n  \texpect(changeMe, 'Did you create a variable named `changeMe`?').to.exist;\n    expect(changeMe, 'Did you set `changeMe` to `false`?').to.eql(false);\n  });\n\n  it('', function() {\n    let structureOne = function() {\n      console.log(changeMe);\n    };\n\n    let isMatchOne = Structured.match(code, structureOne)\n\n    assert.isOk(isMatchOne, 'Did you `console.log()` `changeMe`?')\n  });\n});\n","test_options":{"withBabel":true}}],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2020-04-27T20:33:04Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ef0cb026eebaa00122169d1","slug":"learn-javascript-variables-letV2","type":"node"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":6.183333},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390555","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390556","type":"Narrative","content":"As mentioned in the previous exercise, the `let` keyword was introduced in ES6.

We're performing the mathematical operation of the first operator `+` using the number to the right, then reassigning `w` to the computed value. \n\nWe also have access to other mathematical assignment operators: `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` which work in a similar fashion. \n\n```js\nlet x = 20;\nx -= 5; // Can be written as x = x - 5\nconsole.log(x); // Output: 15\n\nlet y = 50;\ny *= 2; // Can be written as y = y * 2\nconsole.log(y); // Output: 100\n\nlet z = 8;\nz /= 2; // Can be written as z = z / 2\nconsole.log(z); // Output: 4\n```\nLet's practice using these mathematical assignment operators!

In JavaScript, there are eight fundamental data types:\n\n- _Number_: Any number, including numbers with decimals: `4`, `8`, `1516`, `23.42`.\n- _BigInt_: Any number, greater than 2\u003csup\u003e53\u003c/sup\u003e-1 or less than -(2\u003csup\u003e53\u003c/sup\u003e-1), with n appended to the number: 1234567890123456n.\n- _String_: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: `' ... '` or double quotes `\" ... \"`, though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.\n- _Boolean_: This data type only has two possible values\u0026mdash; either `true` or `false` (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a \"yes\" or \"no\" question.\n- _Null_:  This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword `null` (without quotes).\n- _Undefined_: This data type is denoted by the keyword `undefined` (without quotes).  It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than `null`. `undefined` means that a given value does not exist.\n- _Symbol_: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.\n- _Object_: Collections of related data.\n\nThe first 7 of those types are considered _primitive data types_. They are the most basic data types in the language. _Objects_ are more complex, and you’ll learn much more about them as you progress through JavaScript. At first, eight types may not seem like that many, but soon you’ll observe the world opens with possibilities once you start leveraging each one. As you learn more about objects, you’ll be able to create complex collections of data.\n\nBut before we do that, let's get comfortable with strings and numbers!\n\n```js\nconsole.log('Location of Codecademy headquarters: 575 Broadway, New York City');\nconsole.log(40);\n```\nIn the example above, we first printed a string.

Let's call the `.random()` method from the built-in `Math` object:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(Math.random()); // Prints a random number between 0 and 1\n```\nIn the example above, we called the `.random()` method by appending the object name with the dot operator, the name of the method, and opening and closing parentheses. This method returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). \n\nTo generate a random number between 0 and 50, we could multiply this result by 50, like so: \n\n```js\nMath.random() * 50;\n```\n\nThe example above will likely evaluate to a decimal. To ensure the answer is a whole number, we can take advantage of another useful `Math` method called `Math.floor()`. \n\n`Math.floor()` takes a decimal number, and rounds down to the nearest whole number. You can use `Math.floor()` to round down a random number like this:\n\n```js\nMath.floor(Math.random() * 50);\n```\nIn this case:\n1. `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1.\n2. We then multiply that number by `50`, so now we have a number between 0 and 50.\n3. Then, `Math.floor()` rounds the number down to the nearest whole number.\n\nIf you wanted to see the number printed to the terminal, you would still need to use a `console.log()` statement:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 50)); // Prints a random whole number between 0 and 50\n```\n\nTo see all of the properties and methods on the `Math` object, take a look at \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"\u003ethe documentation here\u003c/a\u003e.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439053e","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439053f","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"fae7954a45c3b36d14388b06132b5699","sourceId":null,"title":"Review","slug":"review","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:24Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2020-02-29T22:53:45Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ea9d21b6c7a070012b09a7e","slug":"introduction-to-javascript-review-types-operators","type":"node"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.7},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390548","type":"Narrative","content":"Let's take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:\n\n- Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with `console.log()`.\n- We can write single-line comments with `//` and multi-line comments between `/*` and `*/`.\n- There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.\n- Numbers are any number without quotes: `23.8879`\n- Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: `'Sample String'`\n- The built-in arithmetic operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.\n- Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a `.` after the name of the object, for example: `'Hello'.length`. \n- Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: `'hello'.toUpperCase()`.\n- We can access properties and methods by using the `.`, dot operator. \n- Built-in objects, including `Math`, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.\n\nHere are a few more resources to add to your toolkit:\n\n- [Codecademy Docs: JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript)\n- [Codecademy Workspaces: JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/workspaces/new)\n\nMake sure to bookmark these links so you have them at your disposal.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390546","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390547","type":"OutputTerminal"}]}],"progress":{"__typename":"LessonProgressSummary","content_item_id":"c713e2f51a6e85c0a7937e6e65c5ef5d","started":true,"started_at":"2024-04-03T14:27:39+00:00","completed":true,"completed_at":"2024-04-29T15:41:08+00:00","user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5c76d428aa33d1d2df000015","last_updated":"2024-04-29T15:41:08+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":[10,0],"checklist":null,"kanban":null}},"type":"lesson","progress_pct":100,"exercises_completed":10,"exercises_total":10,"current_exercise_checkpoints_completed":0}},{"__typename":"Quiz","id":"e61daaa3d8a04a5094311d4007efcc52","description":"Test your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals with this quiz.","isDeprecated":null,"isFree":false,"published":true,"slug":"learn-javascript-variables-quiz","title":"Variables","time":null,"type":"quiz","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"progress":{"__typename":"QuizProgressSummary","content_item_id":"e61daaa3d8a04a5094311d4007efcc52","started":false,"started_at":null,"completed":false,"completed_at":null,"user_completed":false,"user_completed_at":null,"user_id":"5c76d428aa33d1d2df000015","last_updated":null,"record":null,"total":null,"correct":null,"pct":null,"highest_pct":null,"passed":false,"passed_any":false,"taken":false,"type":"quiz","quiz_attempts":[]},"assessment_ids":["5b1da44eb2f3fb4fb0092216","5b1da44eb2f3fb4fb0092220","5b1da44eb2f3fb4fb0092233","5b858b1339652c569388ac78","5b1da44eb2f3fb4fb009220b"],"assessments":[{"__typename":"MultipleChoice","id":"5b1da44eb2f3fb4fb0092216","type":"multiple_choice","prompt":"What is the correct way to declare a new variable that you can change?","correct_answer":1,"answers":[{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`let myName: 'Sloan';`","reason":"To declare a variable, you use the `=` operator not a colon."},{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`let myName = 'Sloan';`","reason":"Right on! `let` is used to declare variables that can be changed."},{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`const myName = 'Sloan';`","reason":"A variable declared with `const` cannot be changed."},{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`myName = 'Sloan';`","reason":"We must use a keyword to indicate a variable.

When the answer is \"yes\", the statement evaluates to `true`, and when the answer is \"no\", the statement evaluates to `false`. The code above would be asking: is 10 less than 12? Yes! So `10 \u003c 12` evaluates to `true`. \n\nWe can also use comparison operators on different data types like strings: \n\n```js\n'apples' === 'oranges' // false\n```\n\nIn the example above, we're using the _identity operator_ (`===`) to check if the string `'apples'` is the same as the string `'oranges'`.  Since the two strings are not the same, the comparison statement evaluates to `false`. \n\nAll comparison statements evaluate to either `true` or `false` and are made up of:\n\n* Two values that will be compared. \n* An operator that separates the values and compares them accordingly (`\u003e`, `\u003c`, `\u003c=`,`\u003e=`,`===`,`!==`).\n\nLet's practice using these comparison operators!","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf39067d","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf39067e","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"e5bb570275770607b806929bb8bc4d5c","sourceId":null,"title":"Logical Operators","slug":"logical-operators","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf390687","instructions":"In **main.js** there are two variables `mood` and `tirednessLevel`. \n\nLet's create an `if...else` statement that checks if `mood` is `'sleepy'` and `tirednessLevel` is greater than `8`. \n\nIf both conditions evaluate to `true`, then `console.log()` the string `'time to sleep'`.

In JavaScript, there are operators that work with boolean values known as _logical operators_. We can use logical operators to add more sophisticated logic to our conditionals. There are three logical operators:\n* the  _and_ operator (`\u0026\u0026`)\n* the _or_ operator (`||`)\n* the _not_ operator, otherwise known as the _bang_ operator (`!`)\n\n\nWhen we use the `\u0026\u0026` operator, we are checking that two things are `true`: \n```js\nif (stopLight === 'green' \u0026\u0026 pedestrians === 0) {\n  console.log('Go!');\n} else {\n  console.log('Stop');\n}\n```\nWhen using the `\u0026\u0026` operator, both conditions *must* evaluate to `true` for the entire condition to evaluate to `true` and execute. Otherwise, if either condition is `false`, the `\u0026\u0026` condition will evaluate to `false` and the `else` block will execute. \n\nIf we only care about either condition being `true`, we can use the `||` operator:\n```js\nif (day === 'Saturday' || day === 'Sunday') {\n  console.log('Enjoy the weekend!');\n} else {\n  console.log('Do some work.');\n}\n```\nWhen using the `||` operator, only one of the conditions must evaluate to `true` for the overall statement to evaluate to `true`. In the code example above, if either `day === 'Saturday'` or `day === 'Sunday'` evaluates to `true` the `if`'s condition will evaluate to `true` and its code block will execute. If the first condition in an `||` statement evaluates to `true`, the second condition won't even be checked. Only if `day === 'Saturday'` evaluates to `false` will `day === 'Sunday'` be evaluated. The code in the `else` statement above will execute only if both comparisons evaluate to `false`.\n\nThe `!` _not operator_ reverses, or _negates_, the value of a boolean:\n```js\nlet excited = true;\nconsole.log(!excited); // Prints false\n\nlet sleepy = false;\nconsole.log(!sleepy); // Prints true\n```\nEssentially, the `!` operator will either take a `true` value and pass back `false`, or it will take a `false` value and pass back `true`. \n\nLogical operators are often used in conditional statements to add another layer of logic to our code.

In a boolean condition, JavaScript assigns the truthy value to a variable if you use the `||` operator in your assignment:\n```js\nlet username = '';\nlet defaultName = username || 'Stranger';\n\nconsole.log(defaultName); // Prints: Stranger\n```\nBecause `||` or statements check the left-hand condition first, the variable `defaultName` will be assigned the actual value of `username` if it is truthy, and it will be assigned the value of `'Stranger'` if `username` is falsy. This concept is also referred to as _short-circuit evaluation_. \n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf39068f","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"aa9a756542577e81e0c65243a5b03f39","sourceId":null,"title":"Ternary Operator ","slug":"ternary-operator","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf390698","instructions":"Refactor, or edit, the first `if...else` block to use a ternary operator.

In programming, we often find ourselves needing to check multiple values and handling each of them differently. For example:\n```js\nlet groceryItem = 'papaya';\n\nif (groceryItem === 'tomato') {\n  console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');\n} else if (groceryItem === 'papaya'){\n  console.log('Papayas are $1.29');\n} else {\n  console.log('Invalid item');\n}\n```\nIn the code above, we have a series of conditions checking for a value that matches a  `groceryItem` variable. Our code works fine, but imagine if we needed to check 100 different values! Having to write that many `else if` statements sounds like a pain!\n\nA  [`switch` statement](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/switch?page_ref=catalog) provides an alternative syntax that is easier to read and write. A `switch` statement looks like this:\n\n```js\nlet groceryItem = 'papaya';\n\nswitch (groceryItem) {\n  case 'tomato':\n    console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');\n    break;\n  case 'lime':\n    console.log('Limes are $1.49');\n    break;\n  case 'papaya':\n    console.log('Papayas are $1.29');\n    break;\n  default:\n    console.log('Invalid item');\n    break;\n}\n\n// Prints 'Papayas are $1.29'\n```\n\n* The `switch` keyword initiates the statement and is followed by `( ... )`, which contains the value that each `case` will compare. In the example, the value or expression of the `switch` statement is `groceryItem`.\n* Inside the block, `{ ... }`, there are multiple `case`s. The `case` keyword checks if the expression matches the specified value that comes after it. The value following the first `case` is `'tomato'`. If the value of `groceryItem` equalled `'tomato'`, that `case`'s `console.log()` would run.\n* The value of `groceryItem` is `'papaya'`, so the third `case` runs\u0026mdash; `Papayas are $1.29` is logged to the console.\n* The `break` keyword tells the computer to exit the block and not execute any more code or check any other cases inside the code block. Note: Without `break` keywords, the first matching case will run, but so will every subsequent case regardless of whether or not it matches—including the default. This behavior is different from `if`/`else` conditional statements that execute only one block of code. \n* At the end of each `switch` statement, there is a `default` statement. If none of the `case`s are true, then the code in the `default` statement will run.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a3","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a2","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"1bd8e532511877c26294a58104637186","sourceId":null,"title":"Review","slug":"review-control-flow","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"last_modified_at":"2020-02-29T22:54:48Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ea9d240a69948001117fd98","slug":"learn-javascript-conditionals-review","type":"node"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.25},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf3906ab","type":"Narrative","content":"Way to go!

Measure the width of the rectangle.\n2. Measure the height of the rectangle.\n3. Multiply the width and height of the rectangle.\n\nWith practice, you can calculate the area of the rectangle without being instructed with these three steps every time. \n\nWe can calculate the area of one rectangle with the following code:\n\n```js\nconst width = 10;\nconst height = 6;\nconst area =  width * height;\nconsole.log(area); // Output: 60\n```\nImagine being asked to calculate the area of three different rectangles: \n\n```js\n// Area of the first rectangle\nconst width1 = 10;\nconst height1 = 6;\nconst area1 =  width1 * height1;\n\n// Area of the second rectangle\nconst width2 = 4;\nconst height2 = 9;\nconst area2 =  width2 * height2;\n\n// Area of the third rectangle\nconst width3 = 10;\nconst height3 = 10;\nconst area3 =  width3 * height3;\n```\n\nIn programming, we often use code to perform a specific task multiple times. Instead of rewriting the same code, we can group a block of code together and associate it with one task, then we can reuse that block of code whenever we need to perform the task again. We achieve this by creating a _function_. A function is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task. \n\nIn this lesson, you will learn how to create and use functions, and how they can be used to create clearer and more concise code.","instructions":"Take a look at the provided GIF.

One way to create a function is by using a _function declaration_. Just like how a variable declaration binds a value to a variable name, a function declaration binds a function to a name, or an _identifier_.\nTake a look at the anatomy of a function declaration below:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/declaration.svg\" alt=\"Diagram showing the syntax of a function declaration\"\u003e\n\nA function declaration consists of: \n* The `function` keyword.\n* The name of the function, or its identifier, followed by parentheses.\n* A function body, or the block of statements required to perform a specific task, enclosed in the function’s curly brackets, `{ }`.\n\nA function declaration is a function that is bound to an identifier, or name. In the next exercise we'll go over how to run the code inside the function body. \n\nWe should also be aware of the _hoisting_ feature in JavaScript which allows access to function declarations before they're defined. \n\nTake a look at example of hoisting:\n```js\ngreetWorld(); // Output: Hello, World!\n\nfunction greetWorld() {\n  console.log('Hello, World!');\n}\n```\n\nNotice how hoisting allowed `greetWorld()` to be called before the `greetWorld()` function was defined! Since hoisting isn't considered good practice, we simply want you to be aware of this feature.\n\nIf you want to read more about hoisting, check out \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN documentation on hoisting\u003c/a\u003e. \n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a45e","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a45d","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"518f76047e7387f9211831dfc3e04f49","sourceId":null,"title":"Calling a Function","slug":"functions","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a469","instructions":"Imagine that you manage an online store.

Here we assign a new value to the variable `color` if the `if` statement is truthy.\n- Within the `if` block, the `color` variable holds the value `'pink'`, though outside the `if` block, in the function body, the `color` variable holds the value `'blue'`.\n- On the last line, we attempt to print the value of `color` outside both the `if` statement and the definition of `logSkyColor()`. This will throw a `ReferenceError` since `color` only exists within the scope of those two blocks \u0026mdash; it is never defined in the global scope.\n- While we use block scope, we still pollute our namespace by reusing the same variable name twice. A better practice would be to rename the variable inside the block.\n\nBlock scope is a powerful tool in JavaScript, since it allows us to define variables with precision, and not pollute the global namespace.

For instance, you can write:\n\n```javascript\nconst hello = 'Hello World';\nconsole.log(hello[6]);\n// Output: W\n```\nThe console will display `W` since it is the character that is at index `6`.\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe533f242fc110f7c0fa2","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe533f242fc110f7c0fa3","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"2bd0fed02ba2d5a2e05da7c6419f4a74","sourceId":null,"title":"Update Elements ","slug":"update-elements","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe533f242fc110f7c0fad","instructions":"Change the second element of the array `groceryList` to `'avocados'`. \n","hint":"To reassign an element of an array, access the element by index and then use the `=` operator to assign a new value.

Well what happens if we try to change an array inside a function? Does the array keep the change after the function call or is it scoped to inside the function?\n\nTake a look at the following example where we call `.push()` on an array inside a function. Recall, the `.push()` method mutates, or changes, an array:\n```js\nconst flowers = ['peony', 'daffodil', 'marigold'];\n\nfunction addFlower(arr) {\n  arr.push('lily');\n}\n\naddFlower(flowers);\n\nconsole.log(flowers); // Output: ['peony', 'daffodil', 'marigold', 'lily']\n```\nLet's go over what happened in the example:\n* The `flowers` array that has 3 elements. \n* The function `addFlower()` has a parameter of `arr` uses `.push()` to add a `'lily'` element into `arr`.\n* We call `addFlower()` with an argument of `flowers` which will execute the code inside `addFlower`.\n* We check the value of `flowers` and it now includes the `'lily'` element! The array was mutated! \n\nSo when you pass an array into a function, if the array is mutated inside the function, that change will be maintained outside the function as well. You might also see this concept explained as _pass-by-reference_ since what we're actually passing to the function is a reference to where the variable memory is stored and changing the memory. \n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fcf","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd0","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"9f2ea421b8bbf0d5cd88d37ea9e88129","sourceId":null,"title":"Nested Arrays","slug":"nested-arrays","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fdb","instructions":"Let's make a nested array!

In this lesson, we learned these concepts regarding arrays:\n\n* Arrays are lists that store data in JavaScript. \n* Arrays are created with brackets `[]`.\n* Each item inside of an array is at a numbered position, or index, starting at `0`. \n* We can access one item in an array using its index, with syntax like: `myArray[0]`.\n* We can also change an item in an array using its index, with syntax like `myArray[0] = 'new string'`; \n* Arrays have a `length` property, which allows you to see how many items are in an array.\n* Arrays have their own methods, including `.push()` and `.pop()`, which add and remove items from an array, respectively.\n* Arrays have many methods that perform different tasks, such as `.slice()` and `.shift()`, you can find documentation at the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMozilla Developer Network\u003c/a\u003e website. \n* Some built-in methods are mutating, meaning the method will change the array, while others are not mutating. You can always check the documentation.  \n* Variables that contain arrays can be declared with `let` or `const`. Even when declared with `const`, arrays are still mutable. However, a variable declared with `const` cannot be reassigned. \n* Arrays mutated inside of a function will keep that change even outside the function. \n* Arrays can be nested inside other arrays. \n* To access elements in nested arrays chain indices using bracket notation. \n\nLearning how to work with and manipulate arrays will help you work with chunks of data! \n","instructions":"Looking for more ways to practice?

Iterator variables can have any name, but it’s best practice to use a descriptive variable name.\n\nA `for` loop contains three expressions separated by `;` inside the parentheses: \n1. an _initialization_ starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.\n2. a _stopping condition_ is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated against\u0026mdash; if the condition evaluates to `true` the code block will run, and if it evaluates to `false` the code will stop.\n3. an _iteration statement_ is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.\n\nThe `for` loop syntax looks like this:\n```js\nfor (let counter = 0; counter \u003c 4; counter++) {\n  console.log(counter);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the output would be the following:\n```\n0\n1\n2\n3\n```\n\nLet’s break down the example:\n* The initialization is `let counter = 0`, so the loop will start counting at `0`.\n* The stopping condition is `counter \u003c 4`, meaning the loop will run as long as the iterator variable, `counter`, is less than 4.\n* The iteration statement is `counter++`. This means after each loop, the value of `counter` will increase by 1. For the first iteration `counter` will equal `0`, for the second iteration `counter` will equal 1, and so on.\n* The code block is inside of the curly braces, `console.log(counter)`, will execute until the condition evaluates to `false`. The condition will be false when `counter` is greater than or equal to 4 \u0026mdash; the point that the condition becomes false is sometimes called the _stop condition_.\n\nThis `for` loop makes it possible to write `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` programmatically.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae26a","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae269","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"c29fa351e15793999c178f2afd90e2ad","sourceId":null,"title":"Looping in Reverse","slug":"for-loop-ii","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae272","instructions":"Make a `for` loop that loops backwards printing `3` to `0` to the console.

For example, we can use a `for` loop to perform the same operation on each element on an array. [Arrays](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays?page_ref=catalog) hold lists of data, like customer names or product information. Imagine we owned a store and wanted to increase the price of every product in our catalog. That could be a lot of repeating code, but by using a `for` loop to iterate through the array we could accomplish this task easily. \n\nTo loop through each element in an array, a `for` loop should use the array's `.length` property in its condition. \n\nCheck out the example below to see how `for` loops iterate on arrays:\n```js\nconst animals = ['Grizzly Bear', 'Sloth', 'Sea Lion'];\nfor (let i = 0; i \u003c animals.length; i++){\n  console.log(animals[i]);\n}\n```\n\nThis example would give you the following output:\n```\nGrizzly Bear\nSloth\nSea Lion\n```\nIn the loop above, we've named our iterator variable `i`. This is a variable naming convention you'll see in a lot of loops. When we use `i` to iterate through arrays we can think of it as being short-hand for the word **i**ndex. Notice how our stopping condition checks that `i` is less than `animals.length`. Remember that arrays are zero-indexed, the index of the last element of an array is equivalent to the length of that array minus 1.

We're going to teach you about a different type of loop: the [`while` loop](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/loops?page_ref=catalog). To start, let's convert a `for` loop into a `while` loop:\n```js\n// A for loop that prints 1, 2, and 3\nfor (let counterOne = 1; counterOne \u003c 4; counterOne++){\n  console.log(counterOne);\n}\n\n// A while loop that prints 1, 2, and 3\nlet counterTwo = 1;\nwhile (counterTwo \u003c 4) {\n  console.log(counterTwo);\n  counterTwo++;\n}\n```\nLet's break down what's happening with our `while` loop syntax: \n- The `counterTwo` variable is declared before the loop. We can access it inside our `while` loop since it's in the global scope. \n- We start our loop with the keyword `while` followed by our stopping condition, or _test condition_. This will be evaluated before each round of the loop. While the condition evaluates to `true`, the block will continue to run. Once it evaluates to `false` the loop will stop. \n- Next, we have our loop's code block which prints `counterTwo` to the console and increments `counterTwo`. \n\nWhat would happen if we didn't increment `counterTwo` inside our block? If we didn't include this, `counterTwo` would always have its initial value, `1`. That would mean the testing condition `counterTwo \u003c 4` would always evaluate to `true` and our loop would never stop running! Remember, this is called an _infinite loop_ and it's something we always want to **avoid**. Infinite loops can take up all of your computer's processing power potentially freezing your computer. \n\nSo you may be wondering when to use a `while` loop! The syntax of a `while` loop is ideal when we don’t know in advance how many times the loop should run. Think of eating like a `while` loop: when you start taking bites, you don't know the exact number you'll need to become full. Rather you'll eat `while` you're hungry. In situations when we want a loop to execute an undetermined number of times, `while` loops are the best choice.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae280","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"5ff652197775cc38ceb58babcaa6fba1","sourceId":null,"title":"Do...While Statements","slug":"do-while-statement","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae28b","instructions":"We'd like a program to simulate part of the cake-baking process.

Let's explore the syntax of invoking `.forEach()`. \n* `groceries.forEach()` calls the `forEach` method on the `groceries` array. \n* `.forEach()` takes an argument of callback function. Remember, a callback function is a function passed as an argument into another function. \n* `.forEach()` loops through the array and executes the callback function for each element. During each execution, the current element is passed as an argument to the callback function.\n* The return value for `.forEach()` will always be `undefined`.\n\nAnother way to pass a callback for `.forEach()` is to use arrow function syntax. \n```js\ngroceries.forEach(groceryItem =\u003e console.log(groceryItem));\n```\n\nWe can also define a function beforehand to be used as the callback function.\n```js\nfunction printGrocery(element){\n  console.log(element);\n}\n\ngroceries.forEach(printGrocery);\n```\nThe above example uses a function declaration but you can also use a function expression or arrow function as well. \n\nAll three code snippets do the same thing. In each array iteration method, we can use any of the three examples to supply a callback function as an argument to the iterator. It's good to be aware of the different ways to pass in callback functions as arguments in iterators because developers have different stylistic preferences. Nonetheless, due to the strong adoption of ES6, we will be using arrow function syntax in the later exercises. \n\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a1639026b","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a1639026a","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"ec22cff017452ee3112d55d357864059","sourceId":null,"title":"The .map() Method","slug":"map","published":true,"setup_command":"","created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390273","instructions":"Add your code under the `animals` array and before the line `console.log(secretMessage.join(''));` \n\nUse `.map()` to create a new array that contains the first character of each string in the `animals` array.

Each element in the `jumbledNums` array will be passed to this function as an argument. \n* `num \u003c 10;` is the condition that elements are checked against. `.findIndex()` will return the index of the first element which evaluates to `true` for that condition. \n\nLet's take a look at what `lessThanTen` evaluates to: \n```js\nconsole.log(lessThanTen); // Output: 3 \n```\nIf we check what element has index of 3: \n```js\nconsole.log(jumbledNums[3]); // Output: 5\n```\nGreat, the element in index `3` is the number `5`. This makes sense since `5` is the first element that is less than 10.\n\nIf there isn't a single element in the array that satisfies the condition in the callback, then `.findIndex()` will return `-1`. \n```js\nconst greaterThan1000 = jumbledNums.findIndex(num =\u003e {\n  return num \u003e 1000;\n});\n\nconsole.log(greaterThan1000); // Output: -1\n```","instructions":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"d28a686bc0099a4dd6a506350660b2c5","sourceId":null,"title":"The .reduce() Method","slug":"reduce","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390285","instructions":"Let's practice calling `.reduce()` and using `console.log()` to check the values as `.reduce()` iterates through the array.\n\nIn **main.js**, there is an array of numbers, `newNumbers`.\n\nTo start, declare a new variable named `newSum` using the `const` keyword.

The [`.reduce()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays/reduce?page_ref=catalog) method returns a single value after iterating through the elements of an array, thereby _reducing_ the array.  Take a look at the example below:\n\n```js\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 4, 10];\n\nconst summedNums = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) =\u003e {\n  return accumulator + currentValue\n})\n\nconsole.log(summedNums) // Output: 17\n```\nHere are the values of `accumulator` and `currentValue` as we iterate through the `numbers` array: \n\u003cdiv class=\"narrative-table-container\"\u003e\n\n| Iteration |`accumulator` |`currentValue` |return value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First | 1 | 2 | 3\n| Second | 3 | 4 | 7\n| Third | 7 | 10 | 17\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow let's go over the use of `.reduce()` from the example above: \n* `numbers` is an array that contains numbers. \n* `summedNums` is a variable that stores the returned value of invoking `.reduce()` on `numbers`. \n* `numbers.reduce()` calls the `.reduce()` method on the `numbers` array and takes in a callback function as argument. \n* The callback function has two parameters, `accumulator` and `currentValue`. The value of `accumulator` starts off as the value of the first element in the array and the `currentValue` starts as the second element. To see the value of `accumulator` and `currentValue` change, review the chart above. \n* As `.reduce()` iterates through the array, the return value of the callback function becomes the `accumulator` value for the next iteration, `currentValue` takes on the value of the current element in the looping process. \n\nThe `.reduce()` method can also take  an optional second parameter to set an initial value for `accumulator` (remember, the first argument is the callback function!).  For instance: \n\n```js\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 4, 10];\n\nconst summedNums = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) =\u003e {\n  return accumulator + currentValue\n}, 100)  // \u003c- Second argument for .reduce()\n\nconsole.log(summedNums); // Output: 117\n```\nHere's an updated chart that accounts for the second argument of `100`: \n\u003cdiv class=\"narrative-table-container\"\u003e\n\n| Iteration # |`accumulator` |`currentValue` |return value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First | 100 | 1 | 101\n| Second | 101 | 2 | 103\n| Third | 103 | 4 | 107\n| Fourth | 107 | 10 | 117\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390281","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390282","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"17735007ebeff1004ea04ba83bdd0469","sourceId":null,"title":"Iterator Documentation","slug":"documentation","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a1639028e","instructions":"In the code editor, there is an array called `words`.

If we told you to \"count to three,\" we would expect you to say the numbers \"one\", \"two\", and \"three\". We assumed you would know to start with \"one\" and end with \"three\". With programming, we need to be more explicit with our directions to the computer. Here's how we might tell the computer to \"count to three\":\n\n```js\nfor (let i = 1; i \u003c= 3; i++) {\n  console.log(i);\n}\n```\n\nWhen we speak to other humans, we share a vocabulary that provides quick ways to communicate complicated concepts. When we say the word \"bake\", it calls to mind a familiar subroutine\u0026mdash; preheating an oven, putting something into an oven for a set amount of time, and finally removing it. This allows us to _abstract_ away a lot of the details and communicate key concepts more concisely. Instead of listing all those details, we can say, \"We baked a cake,\" and still impart all that meaning to you. \n\nIn this lesson, we'll learn how to use “abstraction” in programming by writing functions. In addition to allowing us to reuse our code, functions help to make clear, readable programs. If you encounter `countToThree()` in a program, you might be able to quickly guess what the function does without having to stop and read the function's body. \n\nWe're also going to learn about a way to add another level of abstraction to our programming: _higher-order functions_.  _Higher-order functions_ are functions that accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output. This enables us to build abstractions on other abstractions, just like \"We hosted a birthday party\" is an abstraction that may build on the abstraction \"We made a cake.\"","instructions":"Using abstraction allows us to write more modular code, which is easier to read and debug.

A _higher-order function_ is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both! We call functions that get passed in as parameters _callback functions_. Callback functions get invoked during the execution of the higher-order function.\n\nWhen we invoke a higher-order function, and pass another function in as an argument, we don't invoke the argument function. Invoking it would evaluate to passing in the return value of that function call. With callback functions, we pass in the function itself by typing the function name _without_ the parentheses:\n\n\n\n```js\nconst higherOrderFunc = param =\u003e {\n  param();\n  return `I just invoked ${param.name} as a callback function!`\n}\n \nconst anotherFunc = () =\u003e {\n  return 'I\\'m being invoked by the higher-order function!';\n}\n\nhigherOrderFunc(anotherFunc);\n```\n\nWe wrote a higher-order function `higherOrderFunc` that accepts a single parameter, `param`. Inside the body, `param` gets invoked using parentheses. And finally, a string is returned, telling us the name of the callback function that was passed in.\n\nBelow the higher-order function, we have another function aptly named `anotherFunc`. This function aspires to be called inside the higher-order function.\n\nLastly, we invoke `higherOrderFunc()`, passing in `anotherFunc` as its argument, thus fulfilling its dreams of being called by the higher-order function.\n\n```js\nhigherOrderFunc(() =\u003e {\n  for (let i = 0; i \u003c= 10; i++){\n    console.log(i);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we invoked `higherOrderFunc()` with an [anonymous function](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/functions/exercises/function-expressions) (a function without a name) that counts to 10. Anonymous functions can be arguments too!\n\nLet’s get some practice writing higher-order functions.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc21","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"13ad39262619c577db0c8a5fa08fe212","sourceId":null,"title":"Review","slug":"review","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:14:16Z","checkpoints":[],"ein_config":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node-14","server":null},"last_modified_at":"2020-05-27T18:52:02Z","workspace":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ef0e0a21dde1c00126fe11d","slug":"higher-order-functions-functions-as-parameters-revised","type":"node-14"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.1},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"components":[{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc28","type":"Narrative","content":"Great job!

In the example above, the calling object is `goat` and by using `this` we're accessing the `goat` object itself, and then the `dietType` property of `goat` by using property dot notation. \n\nLet's get comfortable using the `this` keyword in a method. \n","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c33c09df242fc454d3dcc12","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c33c09df242fc454d3dcc11","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":null,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"dab6da9e821e8e08d95176b2d83bd7c1","sourceId":null,"title":"Arrow Functions and this","slug":"arrow-and-this","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:14:19Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c33c09df242fc454d3dcc1c","instructions":"Currently the `.checkEnergy()` method is not producing the correct output because it is using arrow function syntax.\n\nRefactor, or change, the method to use a function expression.

When discussing _privacy_ in objects, we define it as the idea that only certain properties should be mutable or able to change in value.\n\nCertain languages have privacy built-in for objects, but JavaScript does not have this feature. Rather, JavaScript developers follow naming conventions that signal to other developers how to interact with a property. One common convention is to place an underscore `_` before the name of a property to mean that the property should not be altered. Here's an example of using `_` to prepend a property. \n\n```js\nconst bankAccount = {\n  _amount: 1000\n}\n```\nIn the example above, the `_amount` is not intended to be directly manipulated. \n\nEven so, it is still possible to reassign `_amount`:\n```js\nbankAccount._amount = 1000000;\n```\n\nIn later exercises, we'll cover the use of methods called _getters_ and _setters_.

Syntactically, it looks like we're reassigning the value of a property. \n\nLike getter methods, there are similar advantages to using setter methods that include checking input, performing actions on properties, and displaying a clear intention for how the object is supposed to be used. Nonetheless, even with a setter method, it is still possible to directly reassign properties.

Here's where _factory functions_ come in. A real world factory manufactures multiple copies of an item quickly and on a massive scale. A factory function is a function that returns an object and can be reused to make multiple object instances. Factory functions can also have parameters allowing us to customize the object that gets returned.\n\nLet's say we wanted to create an object to represent monsters in JavaScript. There are many different types of monsters and we could go about making each monster individually but we can also use a factory function to make our lives easier. To achieve this diabolical plan of creating multiple monsters objects, we can use a factory function that has parameters: \n\n```js\nconst monsterFactory = (name, age, energySource, catchPhrase) =\u003e {\n  return { \n    name: name,\n    age: age, \n    energySource: energySource,\n    scare() {\n      console.log(catchPhrase);\n    } \n  }\n};\n```\n\nIn the `monsterFactory` function above, it has four parameters and returns an object that has the properties: `name`, `age`, `energySource`, and `scare()`. To make an object that represents a specific monster like a ghost, we can call `monsterFactory` with the necessary arguments and assign the return value to a variable:\n\n```js\nconst ghost = monsterFactory('Ghouly', 251, 'ectoplasm', 'BOO!');\nghost.scare(); // 'BOO!'\n```\nNow we have a `ghost` object as a result of calling `monsterFactory()` with the needed arguments. With `monsterFactory` in place, we don't have to create an object literal every time we need a new monster. Instead, we can invoke the `monsterFactory` function with the necessary arguments to \u003cdel\u003etake over the world\u003c/del\u003e make a monster for us!

This means when we pass a variable assigned to an object into a function as an argument, the computer interprets the parameter name as pointing to the space in memory holding that object.  As a result, functions which change object properties actually mutate the object permanently (even when the object is assigned to a `const` variable). \n \n```js\nconst spaceship = {\n  homePlanet : 'Earth',\n  color : 'silver'\n};\n \nlet paintIt = obj =\u003e {\n  obj.color = 'glorious gold'\n};\n \npaintIt(spaceship);\n \nspaceship.color // Returns 'glorious gold'\n \n```\nOur function `paintIt()` permanently changed the color of our `spaceship` object.

This allowed us to reassign it to a new object with `identified` and `'transport type'` properties with no problems. \n - When we tried the same thing using a function designed to reassign the object passed into it, the reassignment didn't stick (even though calling `console.log()` on the object produced the expected result). \n -  When we passed `spaceship` into that function, `obj` became a reference to the memory location of the `spaceship` object, but *not* to the `spaceship` variable. This is because the `obj` parameter of the `tryReassignment()` function is a variable in its own right. The body of `tryReassignment()` has no knowledge of the `spaceship` variable at all! \n - When we did the reassignment in the body of  `tryReassignment()`, the `obj` variable came to refer to the memory location of the object ` {'identified' : false, 'transport type' : 'flying'}`, while the `spaceship` variable was completely unchanged from its earlier value.","instructions":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"461f055d5e438176b653004a8aec2c33","sourceId":null,"title":"Looping Through Objects","slug":"for-in","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcc09","instructions":"Using `for...in`, iterate through the `spaceship.crew` object in the code editor and `console.log()` a list of crew roles and names in the following format: `'[crew member's role]: [crew member's name]'`, e.g.,`'chief officer: Dan'`.

One way to give computers these instructions is with a [`for` loop](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/loops?page_ref=catalog). \n\nThe typical `for` loop includes an _iterator variable_ that usually appears in all three expressions. The iterator variable is initialized, checked against the stopping condition, and assigned a new value on each loop iteration. Iterator variables can have any name, but it’s best practice to use a descriptive variable name.\n\nA `for` loop contains three expressions separated by `;` inside the parentheses: \n1. an _initialization_ starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.\n2. a _stopping condition_ is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated against\u0026mdash; if the condition evaluates to `true` the code block will run, and if it evaluates to `false` the code will stop.\n3. an _iteration statement_ is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.\n\nThe `for` loop syntax looks like this:\n```js\nfor (let counter = 0; counter \u003c 4; counter++) {\n  console.log(counter);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the output would be the following:\n```\n0\n1\n2\n3\n```\n\nLet’s break down the example:\n* The initialization is `let counter = 0`, so the loop will start counting at `0`.\n* The stopping condition is `counter \u003c 4`, meaning the loop will run as long as the iterator variable, `counter`, is less than 4.\n* The iteration statement is `counter++`. This means after each loop, the value of `counter` will increase by 1. For the first iteration `counter` will equal `0`, for the second iteration `counter` will equal 1, and so on.\n* The code block is inside of the curly braces, `console.log(counter)`, will execute until the condition evaluates to `false`. The condition will be false when `counter` is greater than or equal to 4 \u0026mdash; the point that the condition becomes false is sometimes called the _stop condition_.\n\nThis `for` loop makes it possible to write `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` programmatically.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae26a","type":"OutputTerminal"},{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae269","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigator_disabled":true,"no_run_button":null}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"c29fa351e15793999c178f2afd90e2ad","sourceId":null,"title":"Looping in Reverse","slug":"for-loop-ii","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae272","instructions":"Make a `for` loop that loops backwards printing `3` to `0` to the console.

Imagine we owned a store and wanted to increase the price of every product in our catalog. That could be a lot of repeating code, but by using a `for` loop to iterate through the array we could accomplish this task easily. \n\nTo loop through each element in an array, a `for` loop should use the array's `.length` property in its condition. \n\nCheck out the example below to see how `for` loops iterate on arrays:\n```js\nconst animals = ['Grizzly Bear', 'Sloth', 'Sea Lion'];\nfor (let i = 0; i \u003c animals.length; i++){\n  console.log(animals[i]);\n}\n```\n\nThis example would give you the following output:\n```\nGrizzly Bear\nSloth\nSea Lion\n```\nIn the loop above, we've named our iterator variable `i`. This is a variable naming convention you'll see in a lot of loops. When we use `i` to iterate through arrays we can think of it as being short-hand for the word **i**ndex. Notice how our stopping condition checks that `i` is less than `animals.length`. Remember that arrays are zero-indexed, the index of the last element of an array is equivalent to the length of that array minus 1. If we tried to access an element at the index of `animals.length` we will have gone too far!\n\nWith `for` loops, it’s easier for us to work with elements in arrays.","instructions":null},{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae274","type":"OutputTerminal"}]},{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"6642f808bb47dd50f44e97d27ef64045","sourceId":null,"title":"Nested Loops","slug":"for-loops-iii","published":true,"setup_command":null,"created_at":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae27c","instructions":"Imagine you're a big-wig programmer for a social media platform!

We're going to teach you about a different type of loop: the [`while` loop](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/loops?page_ref=catalog). To start, let's convert a `for` loop into a `while` loop:\n```js\n// A for loop that prints 1, 2, and 3\nfor (let counterOne = 1; counterOne \u003c 4; counterOne++){\n  console.log(counterOne);\n}\n\n// A while loop that prints 1, 2, and 3\nlet counterTwo = 1;\nwhile (counterTwo \u003c 4) {\n  console.log(counterTwo);\n  counterTwo++;\n}\n```\nLet's break down what's happening with our `while` loop syntax: \n- The `counterTwo` variable is declared before the loop. We can access it inside our `while` loop since it's in the global scope. \n- We start our loop with the keyword `while` followed by our stopping condition, or _test condition_. This will be evaluated before each round of the loop. While the condition evaluates to `true`, the block will continue to run. Once it evaluates to `false` the loop will stop. \n- Next, we have our loop's code block which prints `counterTwo` to the console and increments `counterTwo`. \n\nWhat would happen if we didn't increment `counterTwo` inside our block? If we didn't include this, `counterTwo` would always have its initial value, `1`. That would mean the testing condition `counterTwo \u003c 4` would always evaluate to `true` and our loop would never stop running! Remember, this is called an _infinite loop_ and it's something we always want to **avoid**. Infinite loops can take up all of your computer's processing power potentially freezing your computer. \n\nSo you may be wondering when to use a `while` loop! The syntax of a `while` loop is ideal when we don’t know in advance how many times the loop should run. Think of eating like a `while` loop: when you start taking bites, you don't know the exact number you'll need to become full. Rather you'll eat `while` you're hungry.

This is where the `do...while`  statement comes in.\n\nA [`do...while`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/loops?page_ref=catalog) statement says to do a task once and then keep doing it until a specified condition is no longer met. The syntax for a `do...while` statement looks like this:\n```js\nlet countString = '';\nlet i = 0;\n\ndo {\n  countString = countString + i;\n  i++;\n} while (i \u003c 5);\n\nconsole.log(countString);\n```\n\nIn this example, the code block makes changes to the `countString` variable by appending the string form of the `i` variable to it. First, the code block after the `do` keyword is executed once. Then the condition is evaluated. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the block will execute again. The looping stops when the condition evaluates to `false`.\n\nNote that the `while` and `do...while` loop are different!

Well wonder no further, because we're going to dive into what ES6 is and how it relates to JavaScript! \n\nFirst, let's bring in some history. JavaScript was introduced in 1995 by the company Netscape Communications as a scripting language for web designers and programmers to interact with web pages. The next year,  Netscape submitted JavaScript to a standards developing organization called Ecma International to create standards for a scripting language (a type of programming language). In 1997, Ecma International released ECMA-262 which sets standards for the first version of a scripting language called ECMAScript, shortened to ES. \n\nThese new ECMAScript standards provided rules for the architecture of JavaScript features. As new programming paradigms emerged and developers sought new features, newer versions of ECMAScript provided a basis for consistency between new and old JavaScript versions. \n\nTo fully distinguish the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript: if you want to create an app or program you can use JavaScript \u0026mdash; if you want to create a new scripting language you can follow the guidelines in ECMAScript. So, when you see ES6 or JavaScript ES6, it means that that version of JavaScript is following the specifications in the sixth edition of ECMAScript! You might also see ES2015 instead of ES6, but both terminologies are referring to the same 6th edition of ECMAScript that was released in 2015. Take a look at the timeline below to see how JavaScript has evolved over the years:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-article-assets/javascript_timeline.svg\" alt=\"Timeline showing the evolution of JS editions from inception to 2018\"\u003e\n\nNow, you may be asking, what makes an update in 2015 still relevant today when there are more recent updates like ES7 and ES8? \n\nWell, despite the release of newer versions, ES6 is actually the biggest update made to ECMAScript since the first edition released in 1997! Some developers even refer to ES6 as \"Modern JavaScript\" because of all the major additions. There were so many great features added to help JavaScript developers that include: \n* new keywords like `let` and `const` to declare variables\n* new function syntax using Arrow functions\n* creation of Classes\n* parameters with default values\n* promises for asynchronous actions\n* and many more!\n\n\nUp-to-date browsers now support most of the ES6 features which allow developers to take advantage of these new additions. ES6 ultimately allows programmers to save time and write more concise code. Take for example pre-ES6 syntax for function expressions:\n```js\nvar greeting = function() {\n  console.log('Hello World!');  \n};\n```\nWith ES6 arrow functions, we can transform the expression above into: \n\n```js\nconst greeting = () =\u003e console.log('Hello World'); \n```\nHowever, arrow functions are not just simply syntactical re-writes. As with other ES6 features, there are other underlying benefits and tradeoffs to consider. Nonetheless, there has been a strong adoption of ES6 in the development community. Benefits such as new ES6 syntax, make it easier to utilize a popular programming paradigm, Object Oriented Programming (OOP). With this change, developers in other languages who are used to OOP have a smoother transition into learning and using JavaScript. Another reason for the popularity of ES6 is correlated with the usage of ES6 in popular frameworks like React.  So, if you want to learn the newest tools and frameworks, you will have to pick up ES6 along the way.  \n\nThis being said, we shouldn’t disregard legacy code, i.e. older versions of JavaScript. In fact, there are still many projects that are built and maintained with legacy code! If you want the ability and freedom to work on any sort of JavaScript project, you should familiarize yourself with pre-ES6 and ES6 JavaScript syntax. But don't worry, we cover both pre-ES6 and ES6 in our JavaScript course.

You can think of variables as little containers for information that live in a computer's memory. Information stored in variables, such as a username, account number, or even personalized greeting can then be found in memory. \n\nVariables also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves.\n\nIn short, variables label and store data in memory.  There are only a few things you can do with variables:\n\n1. Create a variable with a descriptive name.\n2. Store or update information stored in a variable.\n3. Reference or “get” information stored in a variable.\n\nIt is important to distinguish that variables are not values; they contain values and represent them with a name.

Each box represents variables; the values are represented by the content, and the name is represented with the label. \n\nIn this lesson, we will cover how to use the `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords to create variables.","instructions":"When you're ready to start, go to the next exercise!"},"Exercise:d5fd124cce0904a5a1cbcd1e628549b6":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"d5fd124cce0904a5a1cbcd1e628549b6","sourceId":null,"title":"Variables","slug":"intro-variables","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:24Z","checkpoints":[],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2020-04-27T20:26:26Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:5ef0caeb4491b10014c38005"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.63333325},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"LayoutImage:5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054a"},{"__ref":"Narrative:5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054b"}]},"Checkpoint:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390551":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390551","instructions":"Declare a variable named `favoriteFood` using the `var` keyword and assign to it the string `'pizza'`. \n\n","hint":"To use the `var` keyword to declare a variable and initialize it with a string, use the following syntax:\n```js\nvar greet = 'Hello World!';\n```\n","testType":"mochaTest","testCode":"console.log = function() {};\nconst { assert } = require('chai');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst Structured = require('structured');\n\nconst code = fs.readFileSync('main.js', 'utf8');\n\ndescribe('', function () {\n  it('', function() {\n    let structureOne = function() {\n      var favoriteFood = $food\n    };\n    let structureTwo = function() {\n      var favouriteFood = $food\n    };\n\n    varCallbacks = [\n      function($food){\n        if($food.value !== 'pizza'){\n          return {failure: 'Did you assign the variable `favoriteFood` a string of `\\'pizza\\'`?'}\n        }\n        return true\n      }\n    ]\n\n    let isMatchOne = Structured.match(code, structureOne, { varCallbacks });\n\t  let isMatchTwo = Structured.match(code, structureTwo, { varCallbacks });\n\n    assert.isOk(isMatchOne || isMatchTwo, varCallbacks.failure || 'Did you declare a variable named `favoriteFood` using the `var` keyword?');\n  });\n});\n","testOptions":{"withBabel":false}},"Checkpoint:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390552":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390552","instructions":"Declare a variable named `numOfSlices` using the `var` keyword and assign to it the number `8`.","hint":"To use the `var` keyword to declare a variable and initialize it with a number, use the following syntax:\n\n```js\nvar newNum = 1337;\n```\n","testType":"mochaTest","testCode":"console.log = () =\u003e {}\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst { expect } = require('chai')\nconst rewire = require('rewire');\n\nconst code = fs.readFileSync('main.js', 'utf8');\n\n\ndescribe('', function () {\n    it('', function () {\n        let appModule;\n        try {\n            appModule = rewire(\"../main.js\")\n        } catch (e) {\n            expect(true, 'Try checking your code again.

One of the biggest changes was two new keywords, `let` and `const`, to create, or _declare_, variables. Prior to the ES6, programmers could only use the `var` keyword to declare variables. \n\n```js\nvar myName = 'Arya';\nconsole.log(myName);\n// Output: Arya\n```\n\nLet's consider the example above:\n\n1. `var`, short for variable, is a JavaScript _keyword_ that creates, or _declares_, a new variable.\n2. `myName` is the variable's name. Capitalizing in this way is a standard convention in JavaScript called _camel casing_. In camel casing you group words into one, the first word is lowercase, then every word that follows will have its first letter uppercased. (e.g. camelCaseEverything). \n3. `=` is the _assignment operator_. It assigns the value (`'Arya'`) to the variable (`myName`). \n4. `'Arya'` is the _value_ assigned (`=`) to the variable `myName`. You can also say that the `myName` variable is _initialized_ with a value of `'Arya'`. \n5. After the variable is declared, the string value `'Arya'` is printed to the console by referencing the variable name: `console.log(myName)`. \n\nThere are a few general rules for naming variables: \n* Variable names cannot start with numbers. \n* Variable names are case sensitive, so `myName` and `myname` would be different variables. It is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases.\n* Variable names cannot be the same as _keywords_. For a comprehensive list of keywords check out \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN's keyword documentation\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nIn the next exercises, we will learn why ES6's `let` and `const` are the preferred variable keywords by many programmers. Because there is still a ton of code written prior to ES6, it's helpful to be familiar with the pre-ES6 `var` keyword.\n\nIf you want to learn more about `var` and the quirks associated with it, check out the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN var documentation\u003c/a\u003e.\n","instructions":null},"OutputTerminal:5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054e":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054e","type":"OutputTerminal"},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054d":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054d","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigatorDisabled":null,"noRunButton":null},"Exercise:98b591ce37642aedb28909d7f2671467":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"98b591ce37642aedb28909d7f2671467","sourceId":null,"title":"Create a Variable: var","slug":"var","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:24Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390551"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390552"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390553"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2020-07-22T22:44:50Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:5f19ae919d35720012cec706"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":8.2},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"Narrative:5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054f"},{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054e"},{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe54e1d19724a0439054d"}]},"Checkpoint:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390558":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390558","instructions":"Create a `let` variable called `changeMe` and set it equal to the boolean `true`.","hint":"To create a variable using the `let` keyword, first add `let` followed by the name of the variable and use the `=` operator to assign it a value. \n```js\nlet thisVariable = false;\n```\n","testType":"mochaTest","testCode":"console.log = function() {};\nconst { assert } = require('chai');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst Structured = require('structured');\n\nconst code = fs.readFileSync('main.js', 'utf8');\n\ndescribe('', function () {\n  it('', function() {\n    let structureOne = function() {\n      let changeMe = true\n    };\n\n    let isMatchOne = Structured.match(code, structureOne);\n\n    assert.isOk(isMatchOne, 'Did you declare a variable named `changeMe` using the `let` keyword and assign `changeMe` a value of `true`?');\n  });\n});\n","testOptions":{"withBabel":false}},"Checkpoint:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390559":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390559","instructions":"On the line after `changeMe` is declared, set the value of `changeMe` to be the boolean `false`.\n\nTo check if `changeMe` was reassigned, log the value saved to `changeMe` to the console.\n","hint":"In the example below, the variable `thisVariable` is first set to the value `44` then changed to `'I am a string'`.\n```js\nlet thisVariable = 44;\nthisVariable = 'I am a string';\n```","testType":"mochaTest","testCode":"console.log = function() {};\nvar rewire = require('rewire'),\n    appModule = rewire('../main.js');\nconst { assert, expect } = require('chai');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst Structured = require('structured');\n\nconst code = fs.readFileSync('main.js', 'utf8');\n\ndescribe('', function () {\n  it('', function() {\n    const changeMe = appModule.__get__('changeMe')\n  \texpect(changeMe, 'Did you create a variable named `changeMe`?').to.exist;\n    expect(changeMe, 'Did you set `changeMe` to `false`?').to.eql(false);\n  });\n\n  it('', function() {\n    let structureOne = function() {\n      console.log(changeMe);\n    };\n\n    let isMatchOne = Structured.match(code, structureOne)\n\n    assert.isOk(isMatchOne, 'Did you `console.log()` `changeMe`?')\n  });\n});\n","testOptions":{"withBabel":true}},"Workspace:5ef0cb026eebaa00122169d1":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ef0cb026eebaa00122169d1","slug":"learn-javascript-variables-letV2","backendType":"node"},"OutputTerminal:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390555":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390555","type":"OutputTerminal"},"Narrative:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390556":{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390556","type":"Narrative","content":"As mentioned in the previous exercise, the `let` keyword was introduced in ES6.

Keywords are words that are built into the JavaScript language, so the computer recognizes them and treats them specially. \n\nOne action, or method, that is built into the `console` object  is the `.log()` method. When we write `console.log()` what we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console. \n\nIt's going to be very useful for us to print values to the console, so we can see the work that we're doing. \n\n```js\nconsole.log(5); \n```\n\nThis example logs `5`  to the console.

In JavaScript, there are eight fundamental data types:\n\n- _Number_: Any number, including numbers with decimals: `4`, `8`, `1516`, `23.42`.\n- _BigInt_: Any number, greater than 2\u003csup\u003e53\u003c/sup\u003e-1 or less than -(2\u003csup\u003e53\u003c/sup\u003e-1), with n appended to the number: 1234567890123456n.\n- _String_: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: `' ... '` or double quotes `\" ... \"`, though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.\n- _Boolean_: This data type only has two possible values\u0026mdash; either `true` or `false` (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a \"yes\" or \"no\" question.\n- _Null_:  This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword `null` (without quotes).\n- _Undefined_: This data type is denoted by the keyword `undefined` (without quotes).  It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than `null`. `undefined` means that a given value does not exist.\n- _Symbol_: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.\n- _Object_: Collections of related data.\n\nThe first 7 of those types are considered _primitive data types_. They are the most basic data types in the language. _Objects_ are more complex, and you’ll learn much more about them as you progress through JavaScript. At first, eight types may not seem like that many, but soon you’ll observe the world opens with possibilities once you start leveraging each one. As you learn more about objects, you’ll be able to create complex collections of data.\n\nBut before we do that, let's get comfortable with strings and numbers!\n\n```js\nconsole.log('Location of Codecademy headquarters: 575 Broadway, New York City');\nconsole.log(40);\n```\nIn the example above, we first printed a string.

Let's call the `.random()` method from the built-in `Math` object:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(Math.random()); // Prints a random number between 0 and 1\n```\nIn the example above, we called the `.random()` method by appending the object name with the dot operator, the name of the method, and opening and closing parentheses. This method returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). \n\nTo generate a random number between 0 and 50, we could multiply this result by 50, like so: \n\n```js\nMath.random() * 50;\n```\n\nThe example above will likely evaluate to a decimal. To ensure the answer is a whole number, we can take advantage of another useful `Math` method called `Math.floor()`. \n\n`Math.floor()` takes a decimal number, and rounds down to the nearest whole number. You can use `Math.floor()` to round down a random number like this:\n\n```js\nMath.floor(Math.random() * 50);\n```\nIn this case:\n1. `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1.\n2. We then multiply that number by `50`, so now we have a number between 0 and 50.\n3. Then, `Math.floor()` rounds the number down to the nearest whole number.\n\nIf you wanted to see the number printed to the terminal, you would still need to use a `console.log()` statement:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 50)); // Prints a random whole number between 0 and 50\n```\n\nTo see all of the properties and methods on the `Math` object, take a look at \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\"\u003ethe documentation here\u003c/a\u003e.","instructions":null},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe54e1d19724a0439053e":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439053e","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigatorDisabled":true,"noRunButton":null},"OutputTerminal:5c2fe54e1d19724a0439053f":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a0439053f","type":"OutputTerminal"},"Exercise:7e3e96907c10fb075bdcb509b7fc9ac2":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"7e3e96907c10fb075bdcb509b7fc9ac2","sourceId":null,"title":"Built-in Objects","slug":"libraries","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:24Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390542"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390543"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390544"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390545"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2022-06-21T17:41:47Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:5ef0cab31dde1c00126fe09d"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":15.716667},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"Narrative:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390540"},{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe54e1d19724a0439053e"},{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c2fe54e1d19724a0439053f"}]},"Workspace:5ea9d21b6c7a070012b09a7e":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ea9d21b6c7a070012b09a7e","slug":"introduction-to-javascript-review-types-operators","backendType":"node"},"Narrative:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390548":{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390548","type":"Narrative","content":"Let's take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:\n\n- Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with `console.log()`.\n- We can write single-line comments with `//` and multi-line comments between `/*` and `*/`.\n- There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.\n- Numbers are any number without quotes: `23.8879`\n- Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: `'Sample String'`\n- The built-in arithmetic operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.\n- Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a `.` after the name of the object, for example: `'Hello'.length`. \n- Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: `'hello'.toUpperCase()`.\n- We can access properties and methods by using the `.`, dot operator. \n- Built-in objects, including `Math`, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.\n\nHere are a few more resources to add to your toolkit:\n\n- [Codecademy Docs: JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript)\n- [Codecademy Workspaces: JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/workspaces/new)\n\nMake sure to bookmark these links so you have them at your disposal.","instructions":null},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390546":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390546","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigatorDisabled":true,"noRunButton":null},"OutputTerminal:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390547":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe54e1d19724a04390547","type":"OutputTerminal"},"Exercise:fae7954a45c3b36d14388b06132b5699":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"fae7954a45c3b36d14388b06132b5699","sourceId":null,"title":"Review","slug":"review","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:24Z","checkpoints":[],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2020-02-29T22:53:45Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:5ea9d21b6c7a070012b09a7e"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.7},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"Narrative:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390548"},{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390546"},{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c2fe54e1d19724a04390547"}]},"Lesson:c713e2f51a6e85c0a7937e6e65c5ef5d":{"__typename":"Lesson","id":"c713e2f51a6e85c0a7937e6e65c5ef5d","description":"Get to know JavaScript data types and operators.","isDeprecated":false,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"introduction-to-javascript","title":"Introduction to JavaScript ","time":101,"type":"lesson","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"exerciseIds":["927c4e71bee54072ca9e3b03793a0648","fb85d567191a50b36eea559a70e4ad4e","6e565488c8a6500b80e2f1799b9e0034","46d0941a3e955bee4783a4cb616d48b9","452dd8df882d1aab5ad971c2e07f693e","84f4db0b1231c27e4924251802d8414b","7ed68be30e7be7c05f32cd2712a97fc0","e8c7e5da7d13c76a58be940ac054fa4d","7e3e96907c10fb075bdcb509b7fc9ac2","fae7954a45c3b36d14388b06132b5699"],"publishedExerciseIds":["927c4e71bee54072ca9e3b03793a0648","fb85d567191a50b36eea559a70e4ad4e","6e565488c8a6500b80e2f1799b9e0034","46d0941a3e955bee4783a4cb616d48b9","452dd8df882d1aab5ad971c2e07f693e","84f4db0b1231c27e4924251802d8414b","7ed68be30e7be7c05f32cd2712a97fc0","e8c7e5da7d13c76a58be940ac054fa4d","7e3e96907c10fb075bdcb509b7fc9ac2","fae7954a45c3b36d14388b06132b5699"],"exercises":[{"__ref":"Exercise:927c4e71bee54072ca9e3b03793a0648"},{"__ref":"Exercise:fb85d567191a50b36eea559a70e4ad4e"},{"__ref":"Exercise:6e565488c8a6500b80e2f1799b9e0034"},{"__ref":"Exercise:46d0941a3e955bee4783a4cb616d48b9"},{"__ref":"Exercise:452dd8df882d1aab5ad971c2e07f693e"},{"__ref":"Exercise:84f4db0b1231c27e4924251802d8414b"},{"__ref":"Exercise:7ed68be30e7be7c05f32cd2712a97fc0"},{"__ref":"Exercise:e8c7e5da7d13c76a58be940ac054fa4d"},{"__ref":"Exercise:7e3e96907c10fb075bdcb509b7fc9ac2"},{"__ref":"Exercise:fae7954a45c3b36d14388b06132b5699"}],"progress({\"userId\":\"5c76d428aa33d1d2df000015\"})":{"__typename":"LessonProgressSummary","contentItemId":"c713e2f51a6e85c0a7937e6e65c5ef5d","started":true,"startedAt":"2024-04-03T14:27:39+00:00","completed":true,"completedAt":"2024-04-29T15:41:08+00:00","userCompleted":false,"userCompletedAt":null,"userId":"5c76d428aa33d1d2df000015","lastUpdated":"2024-04-29T15:41:08+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":[10,0],"checklist":null,"kanban":null}},"type":"lesson","percentComplete":100,"exercisesCompleted":10,"exercisesTotal":10,"currentExerciseCheckpointsCompleted":0}},"MultipleChoice:5b1da44eb2f3fb4fb0092216":{"__typename":"MultipleChoice","id":"5b1da44eb2f3fb4fb0092216","type":"multiple_choice","prompt":"What is the correct way to declare a new variable that you can change?","correctAnswer":1,"answers":[{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`let myName: 'Sloan';`","reason":"To declare a variable, you use the `=` operator not a colon."},{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`let myName = 'Sloan';`","reason":"Right on! `let` is used to declare variables that can be changed."},{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`const myName = 'Sloan';`","reason":"A variable declared with `const` cannot be changed."},{"__typename":"MultipleChoiceAnswer","text":"`myName = 'Sloan';`","reason":"We must use a keyword to indicate a variable.

These operators are called _comparison operators_.\n\nHere is a list of some handy comparison operators and their syntax:\n\n* Less than: `\u003c`\n* Greater than: `\u003e`\n* Less than or equal to: `\u003c=`\n* Greater than or equal to: `\u003e=`\n* Is equal to: `===`\n* Is not equal to: `!==`\n\nComparison operators compare the value on the left with the value on the right. For instance:\n\n```js\n10 \u003c 12 // Evaluates to true\n```\n\nIt can be helpful to think of comparison statements as questions. When the answer is \"yes\", the statement evaluates to `true`, and when the answer is \"no\", the statement evaluates to `false`. The code above would be asking: is 10 less than 12? Yes! So `10 \u003c 12` evaluates to `true`. \n\nWe can also use comparison operators on different data types like strings: \n\n```js\n'apples' === 'oranges' // false\n```\n\nIn the example above, we're using the _identity operator_ (`===`) to check if the string `'apples'` is the same as the string `'oranges'`.

In JavaScript, there are operators that work with boolean values known as _logical operators_. We can use logical operators to add more sophisticated logic to our conditionals. There are three logical operators:\n* the  _and_ operator (`\u0026\u0026`)\n* the _or_ operator (`||`)\n* the _not_ operator, otherwise known as the _bang_ operator (`!`)\n\n\nWhen we use the `\u0026\u0026` operator, we are checking that two things are `true`: \n```js\nif (stopLight === 'green' \u0026\u0026 pedestrians === 0) {\n  console.log('Go!');\n} else {\n  console.log('Stop');\n}\n```\nWhen using the `\u0026\u0026` operator, both conditions *must* evaluate to `true` for the entire condition to evaluate to `true` and execute. Otherwise, if either condition is `false`, the `\u0026\u0026` condition will evaluate to `false` and the `else` block will execute. \n\nIf we only care about either condition being `true`, we can use the `||` operator:\n```js\nif (day === 'Saturday' || day === 'Sunday') {\n  console.log('Enjoy the weekend!');\n} else {\n  console.log('Do some work.');\n}\n```\nWhen using the `||` operator, only one of the conditions must evaluate to `true` for the overall statement to evaluate to `true`. In the code example above, if either `day === 'Saturday'` or `day === 'Sunday'` evaluates to `true` the `if`'s condition will evaluate to `true` and its code block will execute. If the first condition in an `||` statement evaluates to `true`, the second condition won't even be checked. Only if `day === 'Saturday'` evaluates to `false` will `day === 'Sunday'` be evaluated. The code in the `else` statement above will execute only if both comparisons evaluate to `false`.\n\nThe `!` _not operator_ reverses, or _negates_, the value of a boolean:\n```js\nlet excited = true;\nconsole.log(!excited); // Prints false\n\nlet sleepy = false;\nconsole.log(!sleepy); // Prints true\n```\nEssentially, the `!` operator will either take a `true` value and pass back `false`, or it will take a `false` value and pass back `true`. \n\nLogical operators are often used in conditional statements to add another layer of logic to our code.

In programming, we often find ourselves needing to check multiple values and handling each of them differently. For example:\n```js\nlet groceryItem = 'papaya';\n\nif (groceryItem === 'tomato') {\n  console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');\n} else if (groceryItem === 'papaya'){\n  console.log('Papayas are $1.29');\n} else {\n  console.log('Invalid item');\n}\n```\nIn the code above, we have a series of conditions checking for a value that matches a  `groceryItem` variable. Our code works fine, but imagine if we needed to check 100 different values! Having to write that many `else if` statements sounds like a pain!\n\nA  [`switch` statement](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/switch?page_ref=catalog) provides an alternative syntax that is easier to read and write. A `switch` statement looks like this:\n\n```js\nlet groceryItem = 'papaya';\n\nswitch (groceryItem) {\n  case 'tomato':\n    console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');\n    break;\n  case 'lime':\n    console.log('Limes are $1.49');\n    break;\n  case 'papaya':\n    console.log('Papayas are $1.29');\n    break;\n  default:\n    console.log('Invalid item');\n    break;\n}\n\n// Prints 'Papayas are $1.29'\n```\n\n* The `switch` keyword initiates the statement and is followed by `( ... )`, which contains the value that each `case` will compare. In the example, the value or expression of the `switch` statement is `groceryItem`.\n* Inside the block, `{ ... }`, there are multiple `case`s. The `case` keyword checks if the expression matches the specified value that comes after it. The value following the first `case` is `'tomato'`. If the value of `groceryItem` equalled `'tomato'`, that `case`'s `console.log()` would run.\n* The value of `groceryItem` is `'papaya'`, so the third `case` runs\u0026mdash; `Papayas are $1.29` is logged to the console.\n* The `break` keyword tells the computer to exit the block and not execute any more code or check any other cases inside the code block. Note: Without `break` keywords, the first matching case will run, but so will every subsequent case regardless of whether or not it matches—including the default. This behavior is different from `if`/`else` conditional statements that execute only one block of code. \n* At the end of each `switch` statement, there is a `default` statement. If none of the `case`s are true, then the code in the `default` statement will run.","instructions":null},"OutputTerminal:5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a3":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a3","type":"OutputTerminal"},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a2":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a2","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigatorDisabled":null,"noRunButton":null},"Exercise:23352aa0adda21392ea8cd3b9876ea3b":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"23352aa0adda21392ea8cd3b9876ea3b","sourceId":null,"title":"The switch keyword","slug":"switch","published":true,"setupCommand":"","createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a6"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a7"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a8"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2023-08-18T18:06:09Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:5f0f54d475c5420013d97319"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":11.783333},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"Narrative:5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a4"},{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a3"},{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe5441d197249cf3906a2"}]},"Workspace:5ea9d240a69948001117fd98":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ea9d240a69948001117fd98","slug":"learn-javascript-conditionals-review","backendType":"node"},"Narrative:5c2fe5441d197249cf3906ab":{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe5441d197249cf3906ab","type":"Narrative","content":"Way to go!

Measure the width of the rectangle.\n2. Measure the height of the rectangle.\n3. Multiply the width and height of the rectangle.\n\nWith practice, you can calculate the area of the rectangle without being instructed with these three steps every time. \n\nWe can calculate the area of one rectangle with the following code:\n\n```js\nconst width = 10;\nconst height = 6;\nconst area =  width * height;\nconsole.log(area); // Output: 60\n```\nImagine being asked to calculate the area of three different rectangles: \n\n```js\n// Area of the first rectangle\nconst width1 = 10;\nconst height1 = 6;\nconst area1 =  width1 * height1;\n\n// Area of the second rectangle\nconst width2 = 4;\nconst height2 = 9;\nconst area2 =  width2 * height2;\n\n// Area of the third rectangle\nconst width3 = 10;\nconst height3 = 10;\nconst area3 =  width3 * height3;\n```\n\nIn programming, we often use code to perform a specific task multiple times. Instead of rewriting the same code, we can group a block of code together and associate it with one task, then we can reuse that block of code whenever we need to perform the task again. We achieve this by creating a _function_. A function is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task. \n\nIn this lesson, you will learn how to create and use functions, and how they can be used to create clearer and more concise code.","instructions":"Take a look at the provided GIF.

One way to create a function is by using a _function declaration_. Just like how a variable declaration binds a value to a variable name, a function declaration binds a function to a name, or an _identifier_.\nTake a look at the anatomy of a function declaration below:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/declaration.svg\" alt=\"Diagram showing the syntax of a function declaration\"\u003e\n\nA function declaration consists of: \n* The `function` keyword.\n* The name of the function, or its identifier, followed by parentheses.\n* A function body, or the block of statements required to perform a specific task, enclosed in the function’s curly brackets, `{ }`.\n\nA function declaration is a function that is bound to an identifier, or name. In the next exercise we'll go over how to run the code inside the function body. \n\nWe should also be aware of the _hoisting_ feature in JavaScript which allows access to function declarations before they're defined. \n\nTake a look at example of hoisting:\n```js\ngreetWorld(); // Output: Hello, World!\n\nfunction greetWorld() {\n  console.log('Hello, World!');\n}\n```\n\nNotice how hoisting allowed `greetWorld()` to be called before the `greetWorld()` function was defined! Since hoisting isn't considered good practice, we simply want you to be aware of this feature.\n\nIf you want to read more about hoisting, check out \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN documentation on hoisting\u003c/a\u003e. \n","instructions":null},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c181bf939652c287493a45e":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a45e","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigatorDisabled":true,"noRunButton":null},"OutputTerminal:5c181bf939652c287493a45d":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a45d","type":"OutputTerminal"},"Exercise:ba463ecb76c086b98310c83694d72492":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"ba463ecb76c086b98310c83694d72492","sourceId":null,"title":"Function Declarations","slug":"function-declaration","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c181bf939652c287493a461"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c181bf939652c287493a462"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c181bf939652c287493a463"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c181bf939652c287493a464"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2022-10-06T20:53:40Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:61ba180d155fec0017fe8b6f"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":7.95},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"Narrative:5c181bf939652c287493a45f"},{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c181bf939652c287493a45e"},{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c181bf939652c287493a45d"}]},"Checkpoint:5c181bf939652c287493a469":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a469","instructions":"Imagine that you manage an online store.

However, some functions can take inputs and use the inputs to perform a task. When declaring a function, we can specify its _parameters_.

We use parameters as placeholders for information that will be passed to the function when it is called. \n\nLet’s observe how to specify parameters in our function declaration:\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/Learn-JavaScript/function_parameters.svg\" alt=\"JavaScript syntax for declaring a function with parameters\"\u003e\n\n\nIn the diagram above, `calculateArea()`, computes the area of a rectangle, based on two inputs, `width` and `height`. The parameters are specified between the parenthesis as `width` and `height`, and inside the function body, they act just like regular variables. `width` and `height` act as placeholders for values that will be multiplied together. \n\nWhen calling a function that has parameters, we specify the values in the parentheses that follow the function name. The values that are passed to the function when it is called are called _arguments_.

Then `rectangleArea()` is invoked with the arguments `5` and `7`. But when we went to print the results we got `undefined`. Did we write our function wrong? No! In fact, the function worked fine, and the computer did calculate the area as `35`, but we didn't capture it. So how can we do that?

To create a return statement, we use the `return` keyword followed by the value that we wish to return. Like we saw above, if the value is omitted, `undefined` is returned instead.\n\nWhen a `return` statement is used in a function body, the execution of the function is stopped and the code that follows it will not be executed. Look at the example below:   \n\n```js\nfunction rectangleArea(width, height) {\n  if (width \u003c 0 || height \u003c 0) {\n    return 'You need positive integers to calculate area!';\n  }\n  return width * height;\n}\n```\nIf an argument for `width` or `height` is less than `0`, then `rectangleArea()` will return `'You need positive integers to calculate area!'`. The second return statement `width * height` will not run. \n\nThe `return` keyword is powerful because it allows functions to produce an output.

This is referred to as _implicit return_.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/return.svg\" alt=\"comparing single line and multiline arrow functions\"\u003e\n\nSo if we have a function:\n```js\nconst squareNum = (num) =\u003e {\n  return num * num;\n};\n```\nWe can refactor the function to:\n\n```js\nconst squareNum = num =\u003e num * num;\n```\n\nNotice the following changes:\n\n* The parentheses around `num`  have been removed, since it has a single parameter.\n* The curly braces `{  }` have been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.\n* The `return` keyword has been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.\n\n\n","instructions":null},"OutputTerminal:5c181bf939652c287493a497":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a497","type":"OutputTerminal"},"Exercise:2f37c3f48bcdcf351fd1f156accbd9ce":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"2f37c3f48bcdcf351fd1f156accbd9ce","sourceId":null,"title":"Concise Body Arrow Functions ","slug":"concise-body-arrow","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c181bf939652c287493a49a"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2022-09-16T04:51:12Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:5ef0d7ae0cf2810012f15e30"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":5.883333},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c181bf939652c287493a496"},{"__ref":"Narrative:5c181bf939652c287493a498"},{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c181bf939652c287493a497"}]},"Workspace:5ef0d7ba526f050012810fdb":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ef0d7ba526f050012810fdb","slug":"learn-javascript-functions-functions-review","backendType":"node"},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c181bf939652c287493a49b":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a49b","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigatorDisabled":null,"noRunButton":null},"Narrative:5c181bf939652c287493a49d":{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c181bf939652c287493a49d","type":"Narrative","content":"Give yourself a pat on the back, you just navigated through functions! \n\nIn this lesson, we covered some important concepts about functions: \n\n\n* A _function_ is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.\n\n* A _function declaration_ :\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/declaration.svg\" alt=\"Diagram showing the syntax of a function declaration\"\u003e\n\n\n* A parameter is a named variable inside a function's block which will be assigned the value of the argument passed in when the function is invoked:\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/function_parameters.svg\" alt=\"JavaScript syntax for declaring a function with parameters\"\u003e\n\n* To _call_ a function in your code:\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/name.svg\" alt=\"Diagram showing the syntax of invoking a function\"\u003e\n\n* ES6 introduces new ways of handling arbitrary parameters through _default parameters_ which allow us to assign a default value to a parameter in case no argument is passed into the function.\n\n* To return a value from a function, we use a _return statement_. \n\n* To define a function using _function expressions_:\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/expression.svg\" alt=\"defining a function expression\"\u003e\n\n* To define a function using _arrow function notation_:\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/arrow_notation.svg\" alt=\"\"\u003e \n\n* Function definition can be made concise using concise arrow notation:\n\u003cimg src=\"https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/return.svg\" alt=\"comparing single line and multiline arrow functions\"\u003e\n\nIt's good to be aware of the differences between function expressions, arrow functions, and function declarations.

Scope defines where variables can be accessed or referenced. While some variables can be accessed from anywhere within a program, other variables may only be available in a specific context. \n\nYou can think of scope like the view of the night sky from your window. Everyone who lives on the planet Earth is in the global scope of the stars. The stars are accessible _globally_. Meanwhile, if you live in a city, you may see the city skyline or the river. The skyline and river are only accessible _locally_ in your city, but you can still see the stars that are available globally.\n\nOver the next few exercises, we'll explore how scope relates to variables and learn best practices for variable declaration.

For example, globally scoped variables can collide with other variables that are more locally scoped, causing unexpected behavior in our code. \n\nLet's look at an example of scope pollution in practice so we know how to avoid it:\n\n```js\nlet num = 50;\n\nconst logNum = () =\u003e {\n  num = 100; // Take note of this line of code\n  console.log(num);\n};\n\nlogNum(); // Prints 100\nconsole.log(num); // Prints 100\n```\nYou'll notice:\n- We have a variable `num`.\n- Inside the function body of `logNum()`, we want to declare a new variable but forgot to use the `let` keyword.\n- When we call `logNum()`, `num` gets reassigned to `100`. \n- The reassignment inside `logNum()` affects the global variable `num`.\n- Even though the reassignment is allowed and we won't get an error, if we decided to use `num` later, we'll unknowingly use the new value of `num`.\n\nWhile it's important to know what global scope is, it's best practice to not define variables in the global scope. \n","instructions":null},"OutputTerminal:5c2fe566f242fc10e67c09e2":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe566f242fc10e67c09e2","type":"OutputTerminal"},"Exercise:ab7f96775afd7f9a849eaa253b469647":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"ab7f96775afd7f9a849eaa253b469647","sourceId":null,"title":"Scope Pollution","slug":"global-scope-ii","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:25Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe566f242fc10e67c09e6"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe566f242fc10e67c09e7"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2020-05-18T21:10:59Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:5ef0d81c0aa35b001200543e"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":6.05},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe566f242fc10e67c09e3"},{"__ref":"Narrative:5c2fe566f242fc10e67c09e4"},{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c2fe566f242fc10e67c09e2"}]},"Checkpoint:5c2fe566f242fc10e67c09ec":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe566f242fc10e67c09ec","instructions":"Inside the function body of `logVisibleLightWaves()`, beneath the `region` variable and before the provided `console.log()` statement, create an `if` statement that checks if the `region` is the `'The Arctic'`.

Here we assign a new value to the variable `color` if the `if` statement is truthy.\n- Within the `if` block, the `color` variable holds the value `'pink'`, though outside the `if` block, in the function body, the `color` variable holds the value `'blue'`.\n- On the last line, we attempt to print the value of `color` outside both the `if` statement and the definition of `logSkyColor()`. This will throw a `ReferenceError` since `color` only exists within the scope of those two blocks \u0026mdash; it is never defined in the global scope.\n- While we use block scope, we still pollute our namespace by reusing the same variable name twice. A better practice would be to rename the variable inside the block.\n\nBlock scope is a powerful tool in JavaScript, since it allows us to define variables with precision, and not pollute the global namespace.

These methods are specifically called on arrays to make common tasks, like adding and removing elements, more straightforward. \n\nOne method, [`.push()`,](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays/push?page_ref=catalog) allows us to add items to the end of an array.

That's because `.push()` is a function and one that JavaScript allows us to use right on an array. \n* `.push()` can take a single argument or multiple arguments separated by commas. In this case, we're adding two elements: `'item 3'` and `'item 4'` to `itemTracker`.\n* Notice that `.push()` changes, or _mutates_, `itemTracker`. You might also see `.push()` referred to as a _destructive_ array method since it changes the initial array.\n\nIf you're looking for a method that will mutate an array by adding elements to it, then `.push()` is the method for you!

Well what happens if we try to change an array inside a function? Does the array keep the change after the function call or is it scoped to inside the function?\n\nTake a look at the following example where we call `.push()` on an array inside a function. Recall, the `.push()` method mutates, or changes, an array:\n```js\nconst flowers = ['peony', 'daffodil', 'marigold'];\n\nfunction addFlower(arr) {\n  arr.push('lily');\n}\n\naddFlower(flowers);\n\nconsole.log(flowers); // Output: ['peony', 'daffodil', 'marigold', 'lily']\n```\nLet's go over what happened in the example:\n* The `flowers` array that has 3 elements. \n* The function `addFlower()` has a parameter of `arr` uses `.push()` to add a `'lily'` element into `arr`.\n* We call `addFlower()` with an argument of `flowers` which will execute the code inside `addFlower`.\n* We check the value of `flowers` and it now includes the `'lily'` element! The array was mutated! \n\nSo when you pass an array into a function, if the array is mutated inside the function, that change will be maintained outside the function as well. You might also see this concept explained as _pass-by-reference_ since what we're actually passing to the function is a reference to where the variable memory is stored and changing the memory. \n","instructions":null},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fcf":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fcf","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigatorDisabled":null,"noRunButton":null},"OutputTerminal:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd0":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd0","type":"OutputTerminal"},"Exercise:1fe8b73f832a4d52067f1cb5a4fd666f":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"1fe8b73f832a4d52067f1cb5a4fd666f","sourceId":null,"title":"Arrays and Functions","slug":"array-in-functions","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd3"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd4"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd5"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd6"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2021-11-27T00:42:50Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:61b7bf71293f700016dda026"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":9.55},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"Narrative:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd1"},{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fcf"},{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd0"}]},"Checkpoint:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fdb":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fdb","instructions":"Let's make a nested array!

Then to grab the first element from that array, we use `nestedArr[1][0]` and we get the value of `2`.\n","instructions":null},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd7":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd7","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigatorDisabled":null,"noRunButton":null},"OutputTerminal:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd8":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd8","type":"OutputTerminal"},"Exercise:9f2ea421b8bbf0d5cd88d37ea9e88129":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"9f2ea421b8bbf0d5cd88d37ea9e88129","sourceId":null,"title":"Nested Arrays","slug":"nested-arrays","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fdb"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fdc"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2022-09-21T16:41:53Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:5ef0df909981600012c15eee"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":7.05},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"Narrative:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd9"},{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd7"},{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fd8"}]},"Workspace:5ef0dfa1f87e600012e67057":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ef0dfa1f87e600012e67057","slug":"arrays-review-arrays","backendType":"node"},"OutputTerminal:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fde":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fde","type":"OutputTerminal"},"Narrative:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fdf":{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fdf","type":"Narrative","content":"Nice work! In this lesson, we learned these concepts regarding arrays:\n\n* Arrays are lists that store data in JavaScript. \n* Arrays are created with brackets `[]`.\n* Each item inside of an array is at a numbered position, or index, starting at `0`. \n* We can access one item in an array using its index, with syntax like: `myArray[0]`.\n* We can also change an item in an array using its index, with syntax like `myArray[0] = 'new string'`; \n* Arrays have a `length` property, which allows you to see how many items are in an array.\n* Arrays have their own methods, including `.push()` and `.pop()`, which add and remove items from an array, respectively.\n* Arrays have many methods that perform different tasks, such as `.slice()` and `.shift()`, you can find documentation at the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMozilla Developer Network\u003c/a\u003e website. \n* Some built-in methods are mutating, meaning the method will change the array, while others are not mutating. You can always check the documentation.  \n* Variables that contain arrays can be declared with `let` or `const`. Even when declared with `const`, arrays are still mutable. However, a variable declared with `const` cannot be reassigned. \n* Arrays mutated inside of a function will keep that change even outside the function. \n* Arrays can be nested inside other arrays. \n* To access elements in nested arrays chain indices using bracket notation. \n\nLearning how to work with and manipulate arrays will help you work with chunks of data! \n","instructions":"Looking for more ways to practice? Consider trying these:\n* Use the `.length` property to find the last element of an array.\n* Use the other methods in \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eMDN documentation\u003c/a\u003e not mentioned in the lesson.\n* Take all the elements in an array and make a string.\n* Find the return value of calling `.push()` on an array.\n* Nest an array within an array. \n* Access an element in the nested array. \n"},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fdd":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fdd","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigatorDisabled":true,"noRunButton":null},"Exercise:fab2a9a8e93ab086a876d73cfc5eedd7":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"fab2a9a8e93ab086a876d73cfc5eedd7","sourceId":null,"title":"Review Arrays","slug":"review-arrays","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:23Z","checkpoints":[],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2020-05-18T21:40:08Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:5ef0dfa1f87e600012e67057"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":1.316667},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fde"},{"__ref":"Narrative:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fdf"},{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fdd"}]},"Lesson:bf62a19a64e5bf42f1e1892d6c8f560a":{"__typename":"Lesson","id":"bf62a19a64e5bf42f1e1892d6c8f560a","description":"Learn how to store data in JavaScript with arrays.","isDeprecated":false,"isFree":true,"published":true,"slug":"arrays","title":"Arrays","time":110,"type":"lesson","requiredAgreements":{"__typename":"RequiredAgreements","aiDisclaimer":false},"exerciseIds":["e7a5f21a861ef729332f8ef7d8b204d8","068f41c7b7c4faf95c5375fe4fc98f5e","03fccdc11e11107376390cb329261d55","2bd0fed02ba2d5a2e05da7c6419f4a74","c9c75c561c3c0ece71507d1048e17f53","af1f171805de34d21705a21f02d0d1c0","cab373714e5fcde19f379fb8d9977c31","bce6724d53d14155590ac3c08c0b2fce","73864e03d8c07ed97d72e2fd899a9ef8","1fe8b73f832a4d52067f1cb5a4fd666f","9f2ea421b8bbf0d5cd88d37ea9e88129","fab2a9a8e93ab086a876d73cfc5eedd7"],"publishedExerciseIds":["e7a5f21a861ef729332f8ef7d8b204d8","068f41c7b7c4faf95c5375fe4fc98f5e","03fccdc11e11107376390cb329261d55","2bd0fed02ba2d5a2e05da7c6419f4a74","c9c75c561c3c0ece71507d1048e17f53","af1f171805de34d21705a21f02d0d1c0","cab373714e5fcde19f379fb8d9977c31","bce6724d53d14155590ac3c08c0b2fce","73864e03d8c07ed97d72e2fd899a9ef8","1fe8b73f832a4d52067f1cb5a4fd666f","9f2ea421b8bbf0d5cd88d37ea9e88129","fab2a9a8e93ab086a876d73cfc5eedd7"],"exercises":[{"__ref":"Exercise:e7a5f21a861ef729332f8ef7d8b204d8"},{"__ref":"Exercise:068f41c7b7c4faf95c5375fe4fc98f5e"},{"__ref":"Exercise:03fccdc11e11107376390cb329261d55"},{"__ref":"Exercise:2bd0fed02ba2d5a2e05da7c6419f4a74"},{"__ref":"Exercise:c9c75c561c3c0ece71507d1048e17f53"},{"__ref":"Exercise:af1f171805de34d21705a21f02d0d1c0"},{"__ref":"Exercise:cab373714e5fcde19f379fb8d9977c31"},{"__ref":"Exercise:bce6724d53d14155590ac3c08c0b2fce"},{"__ref":"Exercise:73864e03d8c07ed97d72e2fd899a9ef8"},{"__ref":"Exercise:1fe8b73f832a4d52067f1cb5a4fd666f"},{"__ref":"Exercise:9f2ea421b8bbf0d5cd88d37ea9e88129"},{"__ref":"Exercise:fab2a9a8e93ab086a876d73cfc5eedd7"}],"progress({\"userId\":\"5c76d428aa33d1d2df000015\"})":{"__typename":"LessonProgressSummary","contentItemId":"bf62a19a64e5bf42f1e1892d6c8f560a","started":true,"startedAt":"2024-04-30T17:04:26+00:00","completed":true,"completedAt":"2024-05-01T18:51:32+00:00","userCompleted":false,"userCompletedAt":null,"userId":"5c76d428aa33d1d2df000015","lastUpdated":"2024-05-01T18:51:32+00:00","record":{"__typename":"Progress","state":{"__typename":"ProgressState","attempts":null,"bookmark":[12,0],"checklist":null,"kanban":null}},"type":"lesson","percentComplete":100,"exercisesCompleted":12,"exercisesTotal":12,"currentExerciseCheckpointsCompleted":0}},"Workspace:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fee":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fee","slug":"learn-javascript-arrays-P1","backendType":"javascript"},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fec":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fec","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigatorDisabled":null,"noRunButton":null},"OutputTerminal:5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fed":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe534f242fc110f7c0fed","type":"OutputTerminal"},"Project:f49053b951da23e7fe47cad6cb292f72":{"__typename":"Project","id":"f49053b951da23e7fe47cad6cb292f72","description":"In this project, we're going to practice array methods in JavaScript so you can hone your skills and feel confident taking them to the real world.\nWhy?

One way to give computers these instructions is with a [`for` loop](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/loops?page_ref=catalog). \n\nThe typical `for` loop includes an _iterator variable_ that usually appears in all three expressions. The iterator variable is initialized, checked against the stopping condition, and assigned a new value on each loop iteration. Iterator variables can have any name, but it’s best practice to use a descriptive variable name.\n\nA `for` loop contains three expressions separated by `;` inside the parentheses: \n1. an _initialization_ starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.\n2. a _stopping condition_ is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated against\u0026mdash; if the condition evaluates to `true` the code block will run, and if it evaluates to `false` the code will stop.\n3. an _iteration statement_ is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.\n\nThe `for` loop syntax looks like this:\n```js\nfor (let counter = 0; counter \u003c 4; counter++) {\n  console.log(counter);\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the output would be the following:\n```\n0\n1\n2\n3\n```\n\nLet’s break down the example:\n* The initialization is `let counter = 0`, so the loop will start counting at `0`.\n* The stopping condition is `counter \u003c 4`, meaning the loop will run as long as the iterator variable, `counter`, is less than 4.\n* The iteration statement is `counter++`. This means after each loop, the value of `counter` will increase by 1. For the first iteration `counter` will equal `0`, for the second iteration `counter` will equal 1, and so on.\n* The code block is inside of the curly braces, `console.log(counter)`, will execute until the condition evaluates to `false`. The condition will be false when `counter` is greater than or equal to 4 \u0026mdash; the point that the condition becomes false is sometimes called the _stop condition_.\n\nThis `for` loop makes it possible to write `0`, `1`, `2`, and `3` programmatically.","instructions":null},"OutputTerminal:5c348fe039652c0e78aae26a":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae26a","type":"OutputTerminal"},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c348fe039652c0e78aae269":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae269","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigatorDisabled":true,"noRunButton":null},"Exercise:a3cdeff4357a5756da4eef30dd4fb172":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"a3cdeff4357a5756da4eef30dd4fb172","sourceId":null,"title":"The For Loop","slug":"for-loop","published":true,"setupCommand":"","createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c348fe039652c0e78aae26d"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2023-09-14T19:52:59Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:5ef0e0032192220017a889f0"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":6.25},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"Narrative:5c348fe039652c0e78aae26b"},{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c348fe039652c0e78aae26a"},{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c348fe039652c0e78aae269"}]},"Checkpoint:5c348fe039652c0e78aae272":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae272","instructions":"Make a `for` loop that loops backwards printing `3` to `0` to the console.

For example, we can use a `for` loop to perform the same operation on each element on an array. [Arrays](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays?page_ref=catalog) hold lists of data, like customer names or product information. Imagine we owned a store and wanted to increase the price of every product in our catalog. That could be a lot of repeating code, but by using a `for` loop to iterate through the array we could accomplish this task easily. \n\nTo loop through each element in an array, a `for` loop should use the array's `.length` property in its condition. \n\nCheck out the example below to see how `for` loops iterate on arrays:\n```js\nconst animals = ['Grizzly Bear', 'Sloth', 'Sea Lion'];\nfor (let i = 0; i \u003c animals.length; i++){\n  console.log(animals[i]);\n}\n```\n\nThis example would give you the following output:\n```\nGrizzly Bear\nSloth\nSea Lion\n```\nIn the loop above, we've named our iterator variable `i`. This is a variable naming convention you'll see in a lot of loops. When we use `i` to iterate through arrays we can think of it as being short-hand for the word **i**ndex. Notice how our stopping condition checks that `i` is less than `animals.length`. Remember that arrays are zero-indexed, the index of the last element of an array is equivalent to the length of that array minus 1. If we tried to access an element at the index of `animals.length` we will have gone too far!\n\nWith `for` loops, it’s easier for us to work with elements in arrays.","instructions":null},"OutputTerminal:5c348fe039652c0e78aae274":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae274","type":"OutputTerminal"},"Exercise:c5d2b7b1079b60a9c0053d46f127437a":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"c5d2b7b1079b60a9c0053d46f127437a","sourceId":null,"title":"Looping through Arrays","slug":"for-loops-with-arrays","published":true,"setupCommand":"","createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c348fe039652c0e78aae277"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2023-09-14T19:54:38Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:5ef0e01df87e600012e6707a"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":8.35},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c348fe039652c0e78aae273"},{"__ref":"Narrative:5c348fe039652c0e78aae275"},{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c348fe039652c0e78aae274"}]},"Checkpoint:5c348fe039652c0e78aae27c":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae27c","instructions":"Imagine you're a big-wig programmer for a social media platform!

We're going to teach you about a different type of loop: the [`while` loop](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/loops?page_ref=catalog). To start, let's convert a `for` loop into a `while` loop:\n```js\n// A for loop that prints 1, 2, and 3\nfor (let counterOne = 1; counterOne \u003c 4; counterOne++){\n  console.log(counterOne);\n}\n\n// A while loop that prints 1, 2, and 3\nlet counterTwo = 1;\nwhile (counterTwo \u003c 4) {\n  console.log(counterTwo);\n  counterTwo++;\n}\n```\nLet's break down what's happening with our `while` loop syntax: \n- The `counterTwo` variable is declared before the loop. We can access it inside our `while` loop since it's in the global scope. \n- We start our loop with the keyword `while` followed by our stopping condition, or _test condition_. This will be evaluated before each round of the loop. While the condition evaluates to `true`, the block will continue to run. Once it evaluates to `false` the loop will stop. \n- Next, we have our loop's code block which prints `counterTwo` to the console and increments `counterTwo`. \n\nWhat would happen if we didn't increment `counterTwo` inside our block? If we didn't include this, `counterTwo` would always have its initial value, `1`. That would mean the testing condition `counterTwo \u003c 4` would always evaluate to `true` and our loop would never stop running! Remember, this is called an _infinite loop_ and it's something we always want to **avoid**. Infinite loops can take up all of your computer's processing power potentially freezing your computer. \n\nSo you may be wondering when to use a `while` loop! The syntax of a `while` loop is ideal when we don’t know in advance how many times the loop should run. Think of eating like a `while` loop: when you start taking bites, you don't know the exact number you'll need to become full. Rather you'll eat `while` you're hungry. In situations when we want a loop to execute an undetermined number of times, `while` loops are the best choice.","instructions":null},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c348fe039652c0e78aae280":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae280","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigatorDisabled":true,"noRunButton":null},"Exercise:eb2aa60d762eab68a9c34798712e4c1c":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"eb2aa60d762eab68a9c34798712e4c1c","sourceId":null,"title":"The While Loop","slug":"while","published":true,"setupCommand":"","createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c348fe039652c0e78aae284"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c348fe039652c0e78aae285"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c348fe039652c0e78aae286"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2023-08-16T00:01:20Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:60705453fc761d00106ea087"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":12.566667},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c348fe039652c0e78aae281"},{"__ref":"Narrative:5c348fe039652c0e78aae282"},{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c348fe039652c0e78aae280"}]},"Checkpoint:5c348fe039652c0e78aae28b":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c348fe039652c0e78aae28b","instructions":"We'd like a program to simulate part of the cake-baking process.

During each execution, the current element is passed as an argument to the callback function.\n* The return value for `.forEach()` will always be `undefined`.\n\nAnother way to pass a callback for `.forEach()` is to use arrow function syntax. \n```js\ngroceries.forEach(groceryItem =\u003e console.log(groceryItem));\n```\n\nWe can also define a function beforehand to be used as the callback function.\n```js\nfunction printGrocery(element){\n  console.log(element);\n}\n\ngroceries.forEach(printGrocery);\n```\nThe above example uses a function declaration but you can also use a function expression or arrow function as well. \n\nAll three code snippets do the same thing. In each array iteration method, we can use any of the three examples to supply a callback function as an argument to the iterator. It's good to be aware of the different ways to pass in callback functions as arguments in iterators because developers have different stylistic preferences. Nonetheless, due to the strong adoption of ES6, we will be using arrow function syntax in the later exercises. \n\n","instructions":null},"OutputTerminal:5c2fe5591d19724a1639026b":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a1639026b","type":"OutputTerminal"},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe5591d19724a1639026a":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a1639026a","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigatorDisabled":true,"noRunButton":null},"Exercise:7ec27350ca5af2331f6fe63fe4e01c29":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"7ec27350ca5af2331f6fe63fe4e01c29","sourceId":null,"title":"The .forEach() Method","slug":"for-each","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe5591d19724a1639026e"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2022-09-16T04:31:27Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:61b0f24e0c24240016a1a3ff"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":10.566667},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"Narrative:5c2fe5591d19724a1639026c"},{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c2fe5591d19724a1639026b"},{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe5591d19724a1639026a"}]},"Checkpoint:5c2fe5591d19724a16390273":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390273","instructions":"Add your code under the `animals` array and before the line `console.log(secretMessage.join(''));` \n\nUse `.map()` to create a new array that contains the first character of each string in the `animals` array.

This makes sense since `5` is the first element that is less than 10.\n\nIf there isn't a single element in the array that satisfies the condition in the callback, then `.findIndex()` will return `-1`. \n```js\nconst greaterThan1000 = jumbledNums.findIndex(num =\u003e {\n  return num \u003e 1000;\n});\n\nconsole.log(greaterThan1000); // Output: -1\n```","instructions":null},"Exercise:aaf20370b5feb5fbca17e6ebcba682d9":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"aaf20370b5feb5fbca17e6ebcba682d9","sourceId":null,"title":"The .findIndex() Method","slug":"find-index","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe5591d19724a1639027f"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe5591d19724a16390280"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2022-09-27T19:41:28Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:6193c03cdb79fa000fffc769"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":10.55},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe5591d19724a1639027b"},{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c2fe5591d19724a1639027c"},{"__ref":"Narrative:5c2fe5591d19724a1639027d"}]},"Checkpoint:5c2fe5591d19724a16390285":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390285","instructions":"Let's practice calling `.reduce()` and using `console.log()` to check the values as `.reduce()` iterates through the array.\n\nIn **main.js**, there is an array of numbers, `newNumbers`.\n\nTo start, declare a new variable named `newSum` using the `const` keyword.

The [`.reduce()`](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/arrays/reduce?page_ref=catalog) method returns a single value after iterating through the elements of an array, thereby _reducing_ the array.  Take a look at the example below:\n\n```js\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 4, 10];\n\nconst summedNums = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) =\u003e {\n  return accumulator + currentValue\n})\n\nconsole.log(summedNums) // Output: 17\n```\nHere are the values of `accumulator` and `currentValue` as we iterate through the `numbers` array: \n\u003cdiv class=\"narrative-table-container\"\u003e\n\n| Iteration |`accumulator` |`currentValue` |return value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First | 1 | 2 | 3\n| Second | 3 | 4 | 7\n| Third | 7 | 10 | 17\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow let's go over the use of `.reduce()` from the example above: \n* `numbers` is an array that contains numbers. \n* `summedNums` is a variable that stores the returned value of invoking `.reduce()` on `numbers`. \n* `numbers.reduce()` calls the `.reduce()` method on the `numbers` array and takes in a callback function as argument. \n* The callback function has two parameters, `accumulator` and `currentValue`. The value of `accumulator` starts off as the value of the first element in the array and the `currentValue` starts as the second element. To see the value of `accumulator` and `currentValue` change, review the chart above. \n* As `.reduce()` iterates through the array, the return value of the callback function becomes the `accumulator` value for the next iteration, `currentValue` takes on the value of the current element in the looping process. \n\nThe `.reduce()` method can also take  an optional second parameter to set an initial value for `accumulator` (remember, the first argument is the callback function!).  For instance: \n\n```js\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 4, 10];\n\nconst summedNums = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) =\u003e {\n  return accumulator + currentValue\n}, 100)  // \u003c- Second argument for .reduce()\n\nconsole.log(summedNums); // Output: 117\n```\nHere's an updated chart that accounts for the second argument of `100`: \n\u003cdiv class=\"narrative-table-container\"\u003e\n\n| Iteration # |`accumulator` |`currentValue` |return value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First | 100 | 1 | 101\n| Second | 101 | 2 | 103\n| Third | 103 | 4 | 107\n| Fourth | 107 | 10 | 117\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n","instructions":null},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe5591d19724a16390281":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390281","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["main.js"],"navigatorDisabled":null,"noRunButton":null},"OutputTerminal:5c2fe5591d19724a16390282":{"__typename":"OutputTerminal","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a16390282","type":"OutputTerminal"},"Exercise:d28a686bc0099a4dd6a506350660b2c5":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"d28a686bc0099a4dd6a506350660b2c5","sourceId":null,"title":"The .reduce() Method","slug":"reduce","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:11Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe5591d19724a16390285"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe5591d19724a16390286"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe5591d19724a16390287"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe5591d19724a16390288"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c2fe5591d19724a16390289"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2022-09-16T04:37:08Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:61449b3bde6fe6002598c13b"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":14.583333},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"Narrative:5c2fe5591d19724a16390283"},{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c2fe5591d19724a16390281"},{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c2fe5591d19724a16390282"}]},"Checkpoint:5c2fe5591d19724a1639028e":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c2fe5591d19724a1639028e","instructions":"In the code editor, there is an array called `words`.

If we told you to \"count to three,\" we would expect you to say the numbers \"one\", \"two\", and \"three\". We assumed you would know to start with \"one\" and end with \"three\". With programming, we need to be more explicit with our directions to the computer. Here's how we might tell the computer to \"count to three\":\n\n```js\nfor (let i = 1; i \u003c= 3; i++) {\n  console.log(i);\n}\n```\n\nWhen we speak to other humans, we share a vocabulary that provides quick ways to communicate complicated concepts. When we say the word \"bake\", it calls to mind a familiar subroutine\u0026mdash; preheating an oven, putting something into an oven for a set amount of time, and finally removing it. This allows us to _abstract_ away a lot of the details and communicate key concepts more concisely. Instead of listing all those details, we can say, \"We baked a cake,\" and still impart all that meaning to you. \n\nIn this lesson, we'll learn how to use “abstraction” in programming by writing functions. In addition to allowing us to reuse our code, functions help to make clear, readable programs. If you encounter `countToThree()` in a program, you might be able to quickly guess what the function does without having to stop and read the function's body. \n\nWe're also going to learn about a way to add another level of abstraction to our programming: _higher-order functions_.  _Higher-order functions_ are functions that accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output. This enables us to build abstractions on other abstractions, just like \"We hosted a birthday party\" is an abstraction that may build on the abstraction \"We made a cake.\"","instructions":"Using abstraction allows us to write more modular code, which is easier to read and debug.

Our new `busy()` function can be invoked with parentheses as if that was the name we originally gave our function. \n\nNotice how we assign `announceThatIAmDoingImportantWork` without parentheses as the value to the `busy` variable. We want to assign the value of the function itself, not the value it returns when invoked. \n\nIn JavaScript, functions are _first class objects_. This means that, like other objects you've encountered, JavaScript functions can have properties and methods. \n\nSince functions are a type of object, they have properties such as `.length` and `.name`, and methods such as `.toString()`.

Since functions can behave like any other type of data in JavaScript, it might not surprise you to learn that functions can accept other functions as parameters. A _higher-order function_ is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both! We call functions that get passed in as parameters _callback functions_. Callback functions get invoked during the execution of the higher-order function.\n\nWhen we invoke a higher-order function, and pass another function in as an argument, we don't invoke the argument function. Invoking it would evaluate to passing in the return value of that function call. With callback functions, we pass in the function itself by typing the function name _without_ the parentheses:\n\n\n\n```js\nconst higherOrderFunc = param =\u003e {\n  param();\n  return `I just invoked ${param.name} as a callback function!`\n}\n \nconst anotherFunc = () =\u003e {\n  return 'I\\'m being invoked by the higher-order function!';\n}\n\nhigherOrderFunc(anotherFunc);\n```\n\nWe wrote a higher-order function `higherOrderFunc` that accepts a single parameter, `param`. Inside the body, `param` gets invoked using parentheses. And finally, a string is returned, telling us the name of the callback function that was passed in.\n\nBelow the higher-order function, we have another function aptly named `anotherFunc`. This function aspires to be called inside the higher-order function.\n\nLastly, we invoke `higherOrderFunc()`, passing in `anotherFunc` as its argument, thus fulfilling its dreams of being called by the higher-order function.\n\n```js\nhigherOrderFunc(() =\u003e {\n  for (let i = 0; i \u003c= 10; i++){\n    console.log(i);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we invoked `higherOrderFunc()` with an [anonymous function](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/lessons/functions/exercises/function-expressions) (a function without a name) that counts to 10. Anonymous functions can be arguments too!\n\nLet’s get some practice writing higher-order functions.","instructions":null},"PersistentCodeEditor:5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc21":{"__typename":"PersistentCodeEditor","id":"5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc21","type":"PersistentCodeEditor","files":["app.js"],"navigatorDisabled":null,"noRunButton":null},"Exercise:c11da0845729b9d757f9dd55e7f229ed":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"c11da0845729b9d757f9dd55e7f229ed","sourceId":null,"title":"Functions as Parameters","slug":"functions-as-parameters","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:14:16Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc25"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc26"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc27"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node-14","server":null},"updatedAt":"2022-08-25T07:09:03Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:5ef0e0966f5c20001204b7cb"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":16.166667},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc22"},{"__ref":"Narrative:5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc23"},{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc21"}]},"Workspace:5ef0e0a21dde1c00126fe11d":{"__typename":"Workspace","id":"5ef0e0a21dde1c00126fe11d","slug":"higher-order-functions-functions-as-parameters-revised","backendType":"node-14"},"Narrative:5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc28":{"__typename":"Narrative","id":"5c33c0851d19727d05f7dc28","type":"Narrative","content":"Great job!

Rather, JavaScript developers follow naming conventions that signal to other developers how to interact with a property. One common convention is to place an underscore `_` before the name of a property to mean that the property should not be altered. Here's an example of using `_` to prepend a property. \n\n```js\nconst bankAccount = {\n  _amount: 1000\n}\n```\nIn the example above, the `_amount` is not intended to be directly manipulated. \n\nEven so, it is still possible to reassign `_amount`:\n```js\nbankAccount._amount = 1000000;\n```\n\nIn later exercises, we'll cover the use of methods called _getters_ and _setters_.

In `fullName`, we're accessing both `this._firstName` and `this._lastName`.\n* In the last line we call `fullName` on `person`. In general, getter methods do not need to be called with a set of parentheses.

If we do so, then calling the method will result in an infinite call stack error. One workaround is to add an underscore before the property name like we did in the example above. \n\nGreat, let's go getter!

Here's where _factory functions_ come in. A real world factory manufactures multiple copies of an item quickly and on a massive scale. A factory function is a function that returns an object and can be reused to make multiple object instances. Factory functions can also have parameters allowing us to customize the object that gets returned.\n\nLet's say we wanted to create an object to represent monsters in JavaScript. There are many different types of monsters and we could go about making each monster individually but we can also use a factory function to make our lives easier. To achieve this diabolical plan of creating multiple monsters objects, we can use a factory function that has parameters: \n\n```js\nconst monsterFactory = (name, age, energySource, catchPhrase) =\u003e {\n  return { \n    name: name,\n    age: age, \n    energySource: energySource,\n    scare() {\n      console.log(catchPhrase);\n    } \n  }\n};\n```\n\nIn the `monsterFactory` function above, it has four parameters and returns an object that has the properties: `name`, `age`, `energySource`, and `scare()`. To make an object that represents a specific monster like a ghost, we can call `monsterFactory` with the necessary arguments and assign the return value to a variable:\n\n```js\nconst ghost = monsterFactory('Ghouly', 251, 'ectoplasm', 'BOO!');\nghost.scare(); // 'BOO!'\n```\nNow we have a `ghost` object as a result of calling `monsterFactory()` with the needed arguments. With `monsterFactory` in place, we don't have to create an object literal every time we need a new monster. Instead, we can invoke the `monsterFactory` function with the necessary arguments to \u003cdel\u003etake over the world\u003c/del\u003e make a monster for us!

\n\nLet's review the concepts covered in this lesson:\n* The object that a method belongs to is called the _calling object_.\n* The `this` keyword refers to the calling object and can be used to access properties of the calling object.\n* Methods do not automatically have access to other internal properties of the calling object.\n* The value of `this` depends on where the `this` is being accessed from. \n* We cannot use arrow functions as methods if we want to access other internal properties.\n* JavaScript objects do not have built-in privacy, rather there are conventions to follow to notify other developers about the intent of the code. \n* The usage of an underscore before a property name means that the original developer did not intend for that property to be directly changed. \n* Setters and getter methods allow for more detailed ways of accessing and assigning properties.\n* Factory functions allow us to create object instances quickly and repeatedly. \n* There are different ways to use object destructuring: one way is the property value shorthand and another is destructured assignment. \n* As with any concept, it is a good skill to learn how to use the documentation with objects!

For example `console` is a global JavaScript object and `.log()` is a method on that object. `Math` is also a global JavaScript object and `.floor()` is a method on it. \n\nWe can include methods in our object literals by creating ordinary, colon-separated key-value pairs.

This means when we pass a variable assigned to an object into a function as an argument, the computer interprets the parameter name as pointing to the space in memory holding that object.  As a result, functions which change object properties actually mutate the object permanently (even when the object is assigned to a `const` variable). \n \n```js\nconst spaceship = {\n  homePlanet : 'Earth',\n  color : 'silver'\n};\n \nlet paintIt = obj =\u003e {\n  obj.color = 'glorious gold'\n};\n \npaintIt(spaceship);\n \nspaceship.color // Returns 'glorious gold'\n \n```\nOur function `paintIt()` permanently changed the color of our `spaceship` object. However, reassignment of the  `spaceship` variable wouldn't work in the same way: \n```js\nlet spaceship = {\n  homePlanet : 'Earth',\n  color : 'red'\n};\nlet tryReassignment = obj =\u003e {\n  obj = {\n    identified : false, \n    'transport type' : 'flying'\n  }\n  console.log(obj) // Prints {'identified': false, 'transport type': 'flying'}\n \n};\ntryReassignment(spaceship) // The attempt at reassignment does not work.\nspaceship // Still returns {homePlanet : 'Earth', color : 'red'};\n \nspaceship = {\n  identified : false, \n  'transport type': 'flying'\n}; // Regular reassignment still works.\n```\nLet's look at what happened in the code example:\n\n - We declared this `spaceship` object with `let`. This allowed us to reassign it to a new object with `identified` and `'transport type'` properties with no problems. \n - When we tried the same thing using a function designed to reassign the object passed into it, the reassignment didn't stick (even though calling `console.log()` on the object produced the expected result). \n -  When we passed `spaceship` into that function, `obj` became a reference to the memory location of the `spaceship` object, but *not* to the `spaceship` variable. This is because the `obj` parameter of the `tryReassignment()` function is a variable in its own right. The body of `tryReassignment()` has no knowledge of the `spaceship` variable at all! \n - When we did the reassignment in the body of  `tryReassignment()`, the `obj` variable came to refer to the memory location of the object ` {'identified' : false, 'transport type' : 'flying'}`, while the `spaceship` variable was completely unchanged from its earlier value.","instructions":null},"Exercise:7f657d452d381c660e2a0891cb364305":{"__typename":"Exercise","id":"7f657d452d381c660e2a0891cb364305","sourceId":null,"title":"Pass By Reference","slug":"pass-by-reference","published":true,"setupCommand":null,"createdAt":"2018-11-13T14:12:12Z","checkpoints":[{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcc02"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcc03"},{"__ref":"Checkpoint:5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcc04"}],"einConfig":{"extensions":{"js":{"cmds":["node {{ .fileName }}"]}},"container_type":"node","server":"http"},"updatedAt":"2022-07-26T16:51:51Z","workspace":{"__ref":"Workspace:5ef0e30b6445ed00124e5e8d"},"metrics":{"__typename":"ExerciseMetricsType","upperTimeToCompleteMinutes":15.35},"learningEnvironmentFeatures":{"__typename":"LearningEnvironmentFeature","enablePromptEngineeringChat":null},"layoutComponents":[{"__ref":"OutputTerminal:5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcbff"},{"__ref":"PersistentCodeEditor:5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcbfe"},{"__ref":"Narrative:5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcc00"}]},"Checkpoint:5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcc09":{"__typename":"Checkpoint","id":"5c33c09cf242fc454d3dcc09","instructions":"Using `for...in`, iterate through the `spaceship.crew` object in the code editor and `console.log()` a list of crew roles and names in the following format: `'[crew member's role]: [crew member's name]'`, e.g.,`'chief officer: Dan'`.
